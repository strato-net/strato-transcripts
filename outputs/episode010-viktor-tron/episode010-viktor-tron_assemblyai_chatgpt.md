**[00:03] SPEAKER_00:** So hello, I am Bob Summerwell and this is Early Days of Ethereum with my good friend Victor Tron. So hi Victor, how are you?

**[00:14] SPEAKER_01:** Very, very well, thank you. Hello Bob. Thank you for inviting me to the show. It's wonderful to reminisce.

**[00:22] SPEAKER_00:** Well, great to have you here. So yeah, we bumped into each other in Buenos Aires for Devcon and had hoped to record there, but for one reason or another that never happened. So good to connect you online instead. So, talking about early days of Ethereum: you were very early in Ethereum. What were you doing in your life prior to that that led you to the project?

**[00:58] SPEAKER_01:** Work-wise, I wasn’t exactly very close to the crypto scene, to be honest. I was working on a project with BBC News Labs, the News Juicer project. It was trying to ingest a lot of news sources, like from old photo archives, video archives, and everything, and use speech recognition and categorize it and make it searchable in a very nice way. Of course it’s one of these kind of BBC-sponsored projects no one really needed and it was never really used, but it was a nice project to work on. Anyway, I left the job.

**[01:52] SPEAKER_00:** At that time you were in London, you were living in London?

**[01:56] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I was in London. I left the job because I found Ethereum. I was very excited right away. I guess it was when Gavin visited this kind of new web meetup, some sort—I think it was a new web meetup—and then presented Ethereum. I was absolutely taken aback and I found it amazing and a game changer. What led me to it, to be honest, was I was already quite a bit into Bitcoin, which is kind of interesting because Bitcoin came into my life through a friend I knew from an anarchist club or a Facebook group, basically. He introduced me to it on ideological grounds, but of course I was very interested in tech as well. It took me quite a while to understand what blockchain is, how all these things come together. But by that time I had a solid understanding of the blockchain, and my manager was solid enough so that I could question Gavin and Vitalik that it’s absolutely not going to work, obviously, because of this haunting problem. Bit by bit, when I understood that they all had answers to every question I could ever think of, I had to admit they were probably the geniuses I really wanted to look up to and have in my environment to learn from. It was a very, very great start. So when Gavin presented Ethereum, next day I was already hacking on the C codebase actually, and my first PR—we kind of met in a cafe in Dalston, I think. I remember it was quite impressive that I learned that, having used Mac, he actually was running Linux on it. That was very impressive.

**[04:26] SPEAKER_00:** And so, you mentioned your anarchist group there. Had Bitcoin earlier been interesting to you from that kind of monetary, anarchist, libertarian…?

**[04:48] SPEAKER_01:** When Bitcoin came, this was the time when I even kind of learned what money was, really. Before, I didn’t even grasp this notion. It was a very important time in my life. It was really a game changer to have a framework in which I could totally identify myself with. I don’t know if it’s the right word, but a freedom-seeking individual. I really like this kind of Austrian view of economy and I understood what money was used for and what inflation was. I never really understood before. I came late to the game, let’s say. But yeah, and then it was history after.

**[05:48] SPEAKER_00:** And the “new web” meeting that you mentioned, was that like a recurring meetup that you were going to, or were you regularly going to web meetups?

**[06:01] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, but this one particularly stood out because I saw Vitalik’s presentation, I think in Miami, and so that really got me interested. So I knew what I was in for when I showed up at that meeting in Hoxton Square. I think it was that meeting.

**[06:22] SPEAKER_00:** Sorry, you said Vitalik’s presentation, was that the one that he’d given in Miami?

**[06:28] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, exactly. I knew already what to expect from it, but of course I never really understood, and Gavin helped me quite a bit to understand it. So it was really great.

**[06:44] SPEAKER_00:** Had you been watching a variety of Bitcoin conference talks? Was that a regular thing you were doing at that point—watching?

**[06:54] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, watching YouTube, yes. I was very, very interested and very much into these things. I was hoping changes related to this kind of technology would come a lot earlier. I was already kind of into the hype, or contributed to it myself in a way.

**[07:18] SPEAKER_00:** Had you been following along with things like Mastercoin and Colored Coins and other sort of Bitcoin 2.0 projects?

**[07:31] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, actually I did. It was kind of a… I think it was BitShares at that point. And there was BitShares, I think. And there was this kind of… and then Open Transactions, which was very close to Gavin’s heart, I think. They worked together. I don’t know what came out of that afterward, but interesting. After I left the BBC and that winter—which I spent in Thailand, half in a retreat, and then in my spare time—I was working on the Yellow Paper and worked my way through the really hard notation that Gavin put on paper.

**[08:22] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, a lot of people struggled with that math-heavy notation. So you went to Gav’s presentation, which would have been very early February, so that was only like a week or so after Vitalik’s presentation in Miami. It would have been very, very close.

**[08:49] SPEAKER_01:** Correct.

**[08:51] SPEAKER_00:** So you spoke to Gav there and then you exchanged emails?

**[08:56] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, basically we exchanged emails. He put me on a Skype group. There was a Skype group at the time, I think it was 20-odd people on it—really not a big crowd—and yeah, that’s how it all started. Very nice in the beginning too, these grandiose ideas and chat, and being part of it. I’m super proud and very happy that I managed to be at the forefront of it. It’s kind of a lucky move, to be honest.

**[09:34] SPEAKER_00:** So was it a fair bit later in that year that you started working with Danny on Swarm? Were you doing…?

**[09:46] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that came a little bit later. First of all, in the spring I started working on the Yellow Paper and then a bit on the C. Not a lot. Then I think it was in March or sometime that I showed up at the first Ethereum meetup—maybe not the first, I think you told me it was not the first but the second one—in London.

**[10:11] SPEAKER_00:** This is…

**[10:12] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes, yes.

**[10:13] SPEAKER_00:** So this was organized by Stefan Tual.

**[10:18] SPEAKER_01:** There was a Mihai there who later kind of… I think. And then…

**[10:28] SPEAKER_00:** Sorry, Mihai… Mihăily? Was that right?

**[10:31] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes. And I think who I talked to quite a lot was Jack Du Rose, who then…

**[10:37] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, of Colony.

**[10:39] SPEAKER_01:** Colony fame, exactly. And then there is when I met Jeff first. So Jeff became my boss later.

**[10:48] SPEAKER_00:** He came to London for that meetup.

**[10:50] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes, he did.

**[10:51] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[10:52] SPEAKER_01:** And that’s why I kind of saw that it’s quite an international crowd, from all over the world doing this thing. So I started to take it very seriously. As I said, I left my job and I kind of started contributing to the Go code. After that I was really into Go, and that’s where I contributed most and became part of the Go-Ethereum team after Jeff offered me the job. It was around September, October that year when the Foundation was already actively paying out some salaries or recruiting people on the teams.

**[11:42] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, so the Ethereum Foundation was founded in July of 2014 and then the crowdsale was going through July, August, September. And then the hiring—first wave of “we’ve actually got some money to hire people”—was September, October.

**[12:12] SPEAKER_01:** In October, again, I was negotiating it. Aeron Buchanan, I remember, was my contact then. I don’t know when the Amsterdam office on Weteringschans was actually funded, but I already visited Jeff later in that year there. When I first joined, I was talking with my friends in Hungary, some of them related to this Facebook group, and among them Dani Fényes. There was another person who was very close to Swarm later but never actually entered the scene officially—let him be unnamed. There was some thinking that maybe the four of us can form a group and join as a sub dev team or something. It never happened; we worked at times, just hired individually. And then later that year there was Devcon 0, is that correct?

**[13:22] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah. If we just pop back a little bit: through 2014, prior to the sale and so on, how were things working early in 2014? You mentioned a Skype group. Were most people working through Skype?

**[13:50] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, mainly everything was done by Gavin, Jeff, and Vitalik. The rest of us were just helpers on the way at that time, just catching up. I’m talking about the technical stuff. I’m not really sure about the admin and the Foundation stuff, so I hope no offense is taken, but yeah, for the tech stuff, yes. I think it was actually in July that Jeff shared a kind of “devp2p” theme with me and introduced me into the intricacies of the then-aspiring devp2p protocol. That was my first project in the codebase, which then later was completely rewritten by Felix and the other guys. That was my first attempt at a networking layer at the time. I was trying to say really crazy ideas to Jeff about some developer tooling, contract verification, staging, fake blockchain environment, and stuff. He was adamant there were other things to do, and he was focusing on end-user applications. At the time that was “AlethZero”—I think I was thinking “Ethu” but actually later the Mist browser. It was a browser. He was trying to talk me out of it and said the other group, the C team, is assigned to that anyway, so let me not tread unwanted paths. He brought me back to…

**[16:14] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, well he had Aleph—you had AlethZero, right? AlethZero was an earlier incarnation of that.

**[16:25] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. There were some not-so-glorious tasks as well: I refactored logging and things like this, I remember, in the early days. There was also a time when I was learning Go, because it was not a super popular language. There was a lot of learning to do.

**[16:52] SPEAKER_00:** Go was relatively new at that point. You mentioned the Yellow Paper. In those very early months of 2014, Gav in particular seemed incredibly productive with the C client and the Yellow Paper. Was it usually the code that was leading and then the Yellow Paper was being modeled after that?

**[17:28] SPEAKER_01:** It’s hard for me to say if they really were developing hand in hand. Maybe it’s better to ask him, to be honest. But yes, the productivity and the speed that he was churning out C++—absolutely stunning. A few months after, some of these clients already worked. Jeff was the same; Jeff was also incredible in his productivity. These people were really nice examples in front of us. It was really happy to learn from them.

**[18:12] SPEAKER_00:** I think that triangulation was so important: multiple clients and the spec. You had the Python client, not really production status, but those three groups…

**[18:29] SPEAKER_01:** It’s a glorious statement that Ethereum was always very proud of: multi-client development leading to very solid specs. It’s actually true. But of course that was not the reason. The reason was these brilliant individuals followed their own favorite language and wanted their own clients to build. Ultimately what came out of it is amazing: the specification. I remember only a few times that the spec had to be changed. There’s one case when a modulo operation was not exactly—minus number exactly, not sure. There was another one, I think around Easter 2015, the year leading to the launch. That was a problem where the uncle had… two uncles had the same timestamp, I think, and that led to a fork. I remember I wrote a blog post about this and never published it.

**[19:54] SPEAKER_00:** Talking to Jakob Čapluk, he was an intern at the Berlin office in 2015, and he told me about a hard fork that happened on mainnet around two weeks or so after launching, which I was completely unaware of. Looking back, there was a security announcement by Jutta—patching the Geth client. While I’ve been doing stuff myself running old clients, I saw that as well: if you run geth 1.0.0 or geth 1.0.1, it gets stuck. It can’t go through Frontier blocks. So it was actually a hard fork.

**[20:53] SPEAKER_01:** Do you remember what it was related to? It was interesting that you remembered.

**[20:59] SPEAKER_00:** It was some kind of gas counting or some little bug. But it was funny. It was a thing I was not aware of. It was a hard fork but it was never given a name because it was just an accident.

**[21:22] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, sure.

**[21:23] SPEAKER_00:** You wonder how many more of these little things happened that are forgotten in the mists of time. Through early 2014 you were working initially on the C and then later on the Go. How many people were working on Go in 2014?

**[22:00] SPEAKER_01:** It was really just a few people around. Jeff, I think, was mainly designer. Alex van de Sande from Brazil. And who after him…

**[22:20] SPEAKER_00:** But you were the second team member then, is that right?

**[22:24] SPEAKER_01:** Correct, just about. Or maybe actually the first officially, I’m not sure. The first paid one, I’m not sure. We came roughly at the same time with Alex and with Felix Schör, definitely.

**[22:37] SPEAKER_00:** Right, in terms of employment. But I meant when you were working earlier, when you started, were there other people working on Go-Ethereum ahead of your joining?

**[22:53] SPEAKER_01:** Not really. Jeff was pretty much the only one contributing code, as far as I remember. There was quite a vibrant community of people. Later became Slock.it—there was Nick Szabo around? Like super tall dude, and we were going together to the Bitcoin conference, I think it was in April.

**[23:27] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, you went to Toronto?

**[23:29] SPEAKER_01:** No, it was Amsterdam.

**[23:31] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, okay.

**[23:33] SPEAKER_01:** That’s when I had the chance to really talk to Vitalik quite a bit. It was very nice. I got a big party as well. Nice time.

**[23:52] SPEAKER_00:** Nick Szabo is a name I’ve seen a lot of times and I’ve never really met or spoken to him. I guess he was around a lot early and then maybe disappeared, maybe he’s a bit of an anon guy.

**[24:13] SPEAKER_01:** He never joined. I don’t think he was ever officially part of Ethereum, but he was always around and helping us. I think he was employed by some bank.

**[24:30] SPEAKER_00:** I saw he and some others did the first continuous integration, the build system, and then he did work on the Java client as well.

**[24:44] SPEAKER_01:** That is true. The Java client was mainly led by—what was his name—Roman Mandeleil, who kind of mysteriously disappeared after. I’m not sure what happened to him.

**[25:03] SPEAKER_00:** I did see him on Facebook for quite a time. He seems to have either disappeared or something since.

**[25:10] SPEAKER_01:** But I remember at London Devcon 1 he was definitely around there with the whole EthereumJ team. I don’t know the name…

**[25:21] SPEAKER_00:** EtherCamp.

**[25:24] SPEAKER_01:** That’s correct. Thanks for reminding me. Nostalgia, all these phrases.

**[25:32] SPEAKER_00:** Early 2017 I think he disappeared. They did “Hack the DAO” or some hackathon—there was controversy, it looked like the team bought votes, but were paid out anyway. Then he disappeared, people thought he exit-scammed, but I’m not convinced because it would be the worst exit scam ever, it was so early.

**[26:21] SPEAKER_01:** He’s definitely an able and committed guy.

**[26:29] SPEAKER_00:** You mentioned your collaborative sub team. That’s Ethersphere.

**[26:42] SPEAKER_01:** It was wishful thinking that it might be Ethersphere, but on the other hand I did register that as an organization on GitHub, and it was one of the first Ethereum-related brands in a way, if I can call it a brand. At the time it was only Eris Industries.

**[27:07] SPEAKER_00:** Right, yeah, Eris.

**[27:10] SPEAKER_01:** Who later became Monax, this mammoth marmot thing, and they did some nice work. But yeah, Ethersphere was the home of most of our work, and we were committing through that to the Ethereum codebase.

**[27:32] SPEAKER_00:** So that was yourself, Daniel Nagy…?

**[27:38] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. And later George Fef—Georgi Pfeffer—hired to work on the light client, I think it was in 2015 already. He was not on Devcon 0. But Devcon 0 was already… Danny and me joining, by that time there was quite a bit of past around with him.

**[28:08] SPEAKER_00:** So maybe could you say a bit about Swarm? My understanding is that some of it went an awful long way back.

**[28:20] SPEAKER_01:** I don’t know if you remember, in May 2014 there was a seminal triad of talks in, I think it was in Whitechapel somewhere, or somewhere in London. In that talk was the first appearance of “Web3” in the Ethereum context. These founders realized how decentralization can be extended to support the entire web, be the backend of the entire web. If you extend it to data, app data and hosting, put a data layer on top and then maybe messaging, then you can conceive of it as the world computer with this holy trinity: Ethereum blockchain as the world computer’s CPU, and disk (Swarm), and then Whisper as the messaging layer.

**[29:40] SPEAKER_00:** So you were mentioning Whitechapel. That was meetups that were happening there?

**[29:49] SPEAKER_01:** And I think maybe Ethereum even had some sort of coworking or some high-end office there, maybe a room or two, because we often found Vitalik there. Not entirely sure how it looked. There were a lot of internal meetings as well.

**[30:10] SPEAKER_00:** Would that have been when that famous diagram first surfaced? The one with the circle and apps coming in at the side.

**[30:27] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, that was just about that time, including QML. It was not just HTML, it was QML and Qt as anticipated tech platforms.

**[30:45] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, that’s when Web3 was born. And the crazy protocol names, like after these—which is a lettering in Icelandic.

**[31:04] SPEAKER_00:** Oh yeah, the thorn.

**[31:06] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. That’s when ÐΞV and Swarm were invented—also Vitalik’s gimmicks.

**[31:17] SPEAKER_00:** Those Ethereum subprotocols, right? Subprotocols running on a common basis. Ethereum was just one of many related protocols.

**[31:32] SPEAKER_01:** That’s why I was very dedicated to this whole Ethereum at the time. I understood what it means to have Turing-complete computation secured on its own with the blockchain. They envisioned quite a change in how the internet works if you have Swarm and Whisper and all these things. I liked the idea. Later I learned that not only did we socialize on BitTorrent at the time and wanted to improve, but actually some of us—like Danny operating a DC++ node—had some legal troubles maybe. That brought him directly into implementing this idea of decentralized storage and incentivization, and name resolution when connected.

**[32:45] SPEAKER_00:** Zsolt had mentioned to me that he thought the idea for Swarm had gone back to at least 2011.

**[33:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, there was this idea, of course. I don’t know about 2011, but it was mainly Danny’s idea. He saw the amazing qualities of BitTorrent and also drawbacks: difficulty starting a download, throttling rules, no proper incentives to keep the data, and the problem with individual bits of the file not being addressable right away—you had to use a tracker to resolve them. There’s also a problem with legal prosecution, as you remember. For example in Germany there was prosecution for people who used BitTorrent.

**[34:26] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, I didn’t know that.

**[34:28] SPEAKER_01:** Not at the time, but much later. What Danny was trying to do was come up with an idea of how to chunk things so every chunk is content-addressable, and placement of chunks is part of the DHT. Normally a DHT—like a distributed hash table—is the idea that you put node IDs and chunk IDs of content in the same space and get information about the location, who to download it from, from neighborhoods that have the same address or similar address. There’s usually a metric, like logarithmic distance. Then you can work with Kademlia networks. You iterate through peers: you keep a few peers connected and go closer to this guy, to this guy, and the hash of Star Wars, and you want to watch Star Wars, and you look up where the chunks are to download from. Obviously this is not very private. It’s also not very deniable, and you can have legal problems. If you enforce that certain chunks should reside, you can deny knowing anything about it: the system enforces that parts of the Star Wars story reside. Danny’s genius idea was what we called the DPA. He sent us a preimage archive: a bit of data, where the image is the hash, and the preimage is what’s before hashing—the actual piece of the data. The idea of storing not the location, but the actual data at the place in the DHT, has a direct DHT interpretation as the DPA. That became very important in Swarm. Then a lot of other things came. I remember in 2014—we were sitting in Arena Plaza in Budapest, the three of us with Fefe—talking about how to start implementing because there was pressure to implement the whole thing using UDP as the networking stack because TCP was considered too heavy and too slow. But at the time we already had devp2p. So I suggested maybe instead of UDP, just use TCP but use forwarding, keep-alive connections, permanent connections with peers, use Kademlia through live connections, and each forwarding is locally decided to forward to the closer node, and ultimately move backward: forward the request and backward the chunk. It seemed easy to implement and we did exactly that. It turned out to be one of the best and most interesting choices of Swarm. It allows peer-to-peer accounting to work, and gives privacy features: it obfuscates the originator of the request. No one knows that. When someone upstream is asking you something—“they want to watch Star Wars”—it also solved the opportunistic caching problem: distribute automatically popular content. Retrieval-path forwarding peers can remember some chunks. Interesting how these ideas started and coalesced in 2016 Swarm, I think. The first release was in geth 1.5-something, December 2016. The public alpha was released and I remember there was already viewing video—we called it streaming, but it’s not real-time streaming, it’s watching a video file. There was a nice tweet about that too.

**[40:50] SPEAKER_00:** To take a step back: my understanding of a primary thought with Swarm was the holy trinity: decentralized compute database (the blockchain), Swarm for decentralized file system and storage, Whisper for decentralized messaging. You could have synergy of a primary issue: how do you host the web frontend to make a whole application? You need smart contracts and transactions, but you need an application wrapping around that. The thought that a decentralized storage mechanism could store the HTML and JavaScript, and you want an incentive system so it’s available. Not a tragedy of the commons where only the most popular content is available. Also because building on Ethereum, you’ve got the cryptocurrency to do incentives, smart contracts to implement incentive systems, and it fits together into a holistic unstoppable whole. Even now, there’s an awful lot dependent on centralized hosted services.

**[42:51] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I’m pretty sad about this, to be honest. There’s a lot of these things. I don’t know if you remember this big… was it Bitbase? The biggest crypto heist ever because of the Safe hack. If that had been using Swarm, it would have been much more difficult to change transactions under the hood because they hacked the dev’s account and uploaded something through S3 which then the Safe wallet used. It’s much more difficult if these things are content-addressed. This is how these things work: you start from the blockchain as the single source of truth (like ENS or a service as a name), you resolve it to a content hash, and then the content hash is retrieved from decentralized stores.

**[44:06] SPEAKER_00:** And again, 2016 era was when ENS was coming to life as well.

**[44:16] SPEAKER_01:** Nick Johnson was first part of the Swarm team, as part of the Swarm team. He developed ENS and then later took off.

**[44:31] SPEAKER_00:** I didn’t know he worked on Swarm. I knew he was part of the Geth team, but he did some Swarm as well?

**[44:37] SPEAKER_01:** Definitely. I recruited him, to be honest.

**[44:41] SPEAKER_00:** Fantastic. Did you know him in London?

**[44:45] SPEAKER_01:** No. He was just part of the community, valuable contributions. After that…

**[45:00] SPEAKER_00:** Let me check the timeline. I think he got hired pretty soon after me. I started February 2016 and I think he was maybe June, same time as Hudson. Let’s see: I started February, Greg Colvin in March, Everton Fraga in April, and June—Hudson, Jamie Pitts, and Nick Johnson, all June 2016. You talked about Devcon 0—November 2014 in Berlin. Was that the first time you met quite a number of these people?

**[46:10] SPEAKER_01:** A special memory is meeting Alex Leverington.

**[46:16] SPEAKER_00:** Oh yes, the devp2p fame.

**[46:20] SPEAKER_01:** Very interesting. We had lots of discussions. Very adamant, very stubborn with his own way of thinking about the protocol. He was much more knowledgeable than I was at the time, so I was trying to learn a lot from him. At the same time, we were starting to be a bit more pragmatic, trying to simplify. I remember I first brought together specs for that protocol, and that was not really followed, just right.

**[47:06] SPEAKER_00:** The other piece there is libp2p as part of Protocol Labs/IPFS already existed at that time. That was interesting: devp2p vs libp2p.

**[47:23] SPEAKER_01:** You know how Ethereum kind of suffered from “not invented here” syndrome.

**[47:31] SPEAKER_00:** Not invented here syndrome.

**[47:35] SPEAKER_01:** Thank you. And the RLPx stuff. Then we had our own serialization protocol, like devp2p as well. I have to say devp2p at some point was a leaner protocol for the purposes of including into Swarm. It was less bloated, but it had problems in terms of maintenance. It was not appropriate to start and build everything from scratch. In retrospect it was probably not the best idea.

**[48:21] SPEAKER_00:** That got stuck in execution clients forever. Consensus clients now use libp2p, not RLP, but execution clients got stuck with devp2p forever. I remember discussions in 2016: could you have both protocols, a bridge so some stuff could run over libp2p, relay nodes, because with libp2p you could run in a browser. Devp2p you could never run in a browser. Kumaraswamy was working with somebody from the Parity team, maybe Robert, later 2017/2018, trying to get a light client in browser, but it never quite happened.

**[49:42] SPEAKER_01:** It was only after Swarm left the Foundation when we switched to libp2p and started a BZZ client development.

**[49:52] SPEAKER_00:** I wasn’t aware that transition had happened. Devcon 0: late 2014. Things continued through 2015 up to mainnet launch.

**[50:16] SPEAKER_01:** Swarm was just an idea, mainly meant to be specced out or started by Danny who had an interesting past with decentralized storage. He presented his vision at Devcon 0. Everyone should watch it. Very good early capturing of the idea.

**[50:46] SPEAKER_00:** And at that point he got hired in, and it became an official thread of development within the Ethereum stack.

**[50:59] SPEAKER_01:** Absolutely correct. Later, as time went by, people gathered around him and continued churning out code. After that it organically became a sub-team. I never really contributed to the first bit he programmed on.

**[51:32] SPEAKER_00:** He told me he thought that’s what he’d be doing when he was hired, but Jeff told him, no, you’re working on Geth.

**[51:48] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. He signed to develop the incentivized retrieval protocol, which he worked on for many years. It’s a bit sad it never took off. But a lot of things happened.

**[52:07] SPEAKER_00:** That’s where my own journey started. When I got interested in Ethereum, the first thing I wanted to do was mobile and wearables. I wanted to see if I could run an Ethereum node on my smartwatch. I was doing ARM Linux cross-builds of cpp-ethereum. My thought: light client is still being worked out but I’ll get a full client working on devices and when light client comes out, they’ll just work. I can run a full client on a testnet and make sure it works. It’s just a matter of time: of course we’ll have light clients, everything will scale, you can run it on any devices. Every phone will have an Ethereum node, every router, media box. It will come with every Linux distro as a service. It didn’t quite happen.

**[53:16] SPEAKER_01:** We’re still suffering RPC and centralized access, right? How unstoppable is that?

**[53:23] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[53:55] SPEAKER_01:** Ten years in, maybe things are starting. I don’t know if you know the “Deboot” project, for example.

**[54:04] SPEAKER_00:** No. What’s that?

**[54:06] SPEAKER_01:** How to boot from Swarm, basically.

**[54:12] SPEAKER_00:** Booting from Swarm.

**[54:14] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. They’re building this kind of UEFI client. It can bring up any operating system.

**[54:30] SPEAKER_00:** Wow. That’s interesting.

**[54:33] SPEAKER_01:** It’s not worked out fully yet, but the guys…

**[54:42] SPEAKER_00:** There’s a fair bit of networking that has to happen before you could even start. You’d need some bootstrapping mini OS.

**[54:57] SPEAKER_01:** It seems that even before that, you can do it. They already have that pattern: a small Linux-like environment is created and they move from that. They can do it just with the method.

**[55:18] SPEAKER_00:** Through those early years prior to mainnet launch, you mentioned work on the Yellow Paper. How was it determined what “feature complete” or “good enough” looked like before launch could happen?

**[55:49] SPEAKER_01:** I didn’t have a clear idea because it took me a while to understand the whole system. It’s only Jeff who really understood what needed to be built, and he was building massive things single-handedly. It’s really crazy. I remember I was assigned the task of building the block pool, supposed to take blocks from other clients, build the header chain, validate it, etc. I was working a lot on that, and at some point he had enough and said, “Okay, I just build it,” and basically in one or two days it was done. Interesting experience.

**[56:54] SPEAKER_00:** And Christoph Jentzsch was building the cross-client tests as well. Did you work with those tests yourselves?

**[57:06] SPEAKER_01:** No, I didn’t myself, but I remember he was always running it and he found a lot of things through that.

**[57:24] SPEAKER_00:** In July 2015 we had the arrival of Ming Chan, and shortly afterwards serious budget cuts because within that year the Foundation had managed to burn through the vast majority of the money.

**[57:49] SPEAKER_01:** Austerity, I think that was the official name. I remember at the time Vitalik basically said that “Oasis is not going to be Swarm.” What’s going to be is maybe we just use IPFS and try to work on the incentive system we can put on that.

**[58:10] SPEAKER_00:** Okay.

**[58:12] SPEAKER_01:** Maybe it’s not a secret anymore, but Jeff let us keep working on Swarm throughout this period. Very soon after, we were basically ready with the incentivization scheme for bandwidth incentives. Swarm seems to be one of the only decentralized storage systems that has a proper bandwidth incentive and accounting system, like this “SWAP” accounting. I don’t know if any other proper way exists, because bandwidth is instant gratification: you forward a request or not. It’s not like storage where it’s a future promise, you record your deal on-chain, proofs of availability, etc. Bandwidth seems easier with peer-to-peer accounting: I forward for you, you forward for me, and if there’s a big tilt then some settlement should happen, but maybe not even. Then we had the checkbook idea—an early version of payment channels or micropayment solution. Bandwidth incentive was powerful. Storage incentivization was much more difficult. Negative incentives to solve pricing and who’s responsible for what, and if everything is on-chain, privacy, it’s very difficult. That came much later. Only after the token, the Swarm token, was released—2021. Anyway, going back to austerity…

**[1:01:27] SPEAKER_00:** So you were continuing to work through late 2015 even though it had supposedly been defunded?

**[1:01:35] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, kind of. We were trying to figure out incentives, so in that sense we were not off track. I was also working on the Go-Ethereum client on many aspects. By 2017 the Swarm client was integrated and released within Go-Ethereum. It was 2018 when this proof-of-concept release was part of Geth. When Swarm client was starting, you start the standalone swarm.

**[1:02:43] SPEAKER_00:** Starting 2018, you said.

**[1:02:45] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, proof-of-concept three.

**[1:02:52] SPEAKER_00:** So all the way through until that point you were continuing to work as a Geth team member.

**[1:03:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, officially we were part of the Geth entity. Slowly extending the team as the protocol got some movement. In 2016 after Nick Johnson left, we hired other people on the protocol, and that’s when I emerged as team leader organically, trying to pull together the threads.

**[1:03:57] SPEAKER_00:** With the Swarm Foundation, how and when did that happen, and how did you come to leave the Geth team?

**[1:04:12] SPEAKER_01:** Since 2018 autumn—actually 2018 summer—a person called Albert Ni started to offer help for Swarm. They were asking what we need. They seemed helpful.

**[1:04:36] SPEAKER_00:** Albert Ni? This is…

**[1:04:40] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, I think so.

**[1:04:42] SPEAKER_00:** Who had basically joined the Ethereum Foundation at the same time as Aya.

**[1:04:47] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. To be honest, I’m on very good terms with Ming and before. Albert was very helpful and tried to solve staffing problems and things. Negotiations started, and after that by Prague we got into serious discussions. I think on the last day of Devcon Prague we submitted the proposal for funding. I never really got serious feedback and wondered what happened. Then there were issues with Sean O’Connor, as the point of contact delegated by…

**[1:05:51] SPEAKER_00:** Who?

**[1:05:52] SPEAKER_01:** Sorry, Sean O’Connor. He was the delegated point of contact for us, the Swarm team. Slowly, after that, the EF scope changed and every team needed to submit a proposal. This scheme started of trying to graduate some of the teams and protocols out of the Foundation, have them get individual funding, bridge the gap with some grants. That’s what happened with Swarm as well. In 2019 there was a Swarm summit in Madrid, very successful. A lot of partnerships, some monetary help. The Foundation also promised to back it up, and somehow that never happened. We resorted to launching our own token, which we did in 2021. It was already one year into the new Swarm client, the BZZ client. When we launched the token, we started with new life breathed into the whole thing. That’s when we started working seriously on implementing positive storage incentives. The rest of the features came.

**[1:08:02] SPEAKER_00:** Was that the same sort of time as the codebase became independent? Did that coincide: independent thing, new client, switch to libp2p, not integrated with Geth? Or did tech happen earlier?

**[1:08:28] SPEAKER_01:** Not really. The Swarm codebase was taken out of Go-Ethereum quite a lot before. Maybe 2019. I’m not sure, but I think it was proof-of-concept four. When it was taken out, I think it was too expensive or something. It’s not a good idea to mix the two. We were very separate, separate development scheme and agenda.

**[1:09:18] SPEAKER_00:** Nick Johnson’s experience spinning out ENS and the ENS Foundation would have preceded yours. Perhaps you were looking to that as a pattern. Sorry, we’re getting some bad audio. Can you move closer?

**[1:09:40] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. Can you hear me now?

**[1:09:42] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, that’s better.

**[1:09:43] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, very inspiring. We did get a grant from the Foundation, a bridging grant. Later, somehow, it never materialized with that program that had budget put together, but ultimately we made it. We had our own foundation in Switzerland, started the Swarm Association, which issued the token. That’s a new year of development.

**[1:10:29] SPEAKER_00:** One thing we skipped over: Devcon 1. That was in London in November 2015. I assume you were there. What are your memories of that event?

**[1:10:45] SPEAKER_01:** I recently rewatched it and I remember I was pretty much very sick already. I don’t know if you know, but I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2015—15 years ago? And when I did Devcon 1, it was not very easy to follow. I was surprised; I didn’t remember at the time that it was so difficult in terms of my movement. Sorry for that unsolicited diversion. As for the content, I remember we had a very successful presentation of Swarm. There was a lot of interest at the time.

**[1:11:48] SPEAKER_00:** I was looking back at some Devcon 1 videos recently. My takeaway: so many ideas were presented. Nearly anything you can think of in different areas, somebody was working on it. A real flourishing of people building on Ethereum by that point.

**[1:12:23] SPEAKER_01:** I remember we always thought from next year we’re going to have wonderful decentralized services: decentralized Deliveroo, decentralized eBay, decentralized Uber and Airbnb, all kinds of things. And they all need Swarm or content distribution or scalable data layer behind it. That came much, much later.

**[1:13:03] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, many of them five or ten years too early.

**[1:13:06] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. That’s definitely what happened to Swarm: it did not materialize much later. Now at least it’s working.

**[1:13:25] SPEAKER_00:** Can you talk a little bit about where Swarm is now? What’s happening? How’s the functionality?

**[1:13:35] SPEAKER_01:** We have a quite solid network and consolidated a narrow definition of the protocol. Basically it’s the DPA, the distributed chunk store definition, where nodes communicate and distribute chunks. It’s a storage model as well as a content distribution network. It has strong privacy properties which are quite unique. You have the checkbook and postage stamp. Postage stamp is something you attach to a chunk of data to keep it alive, and that’s a hot wallet: you put some money on it, some storage rent gets deducted, and until it runs out of funds your content is live and available. We implemented a manifest idea early: mapping of strings to documents, like key-value storage from a sitemap, and also a directory tree. So you can implement directories and files. We were talking about erasure codes in 2016; it got implemented maybe two or three years ago. There’s also ACT, access control, which allows you to manage grantees that can access a file or directory: a way to get to the decryption key for encrypted content. One of the interesting features in Swarm is mutability: Swarm feeds. It’s basically some sub-block ENS, if you think about it. Integrity of the chunk is not by the content but by some semantic convention: “it’s my website,” “my CV,” hashed together with your Ethereum address. The mutable content is attested by signature. The signature is the integrity, and that’s how we handle mutable content. This is for quickly changing stuff like databases and things.

**[1:17:19] SPEAKER_00:** Where would you say Swarm as of 2026 sits and compares with IPFS plus Filecoin or Arweave or others? How do they differ and what kind of uses?

**[1:17:40] SPEAKER_01:** You’re asking me. You probably want a technical answer. It’s difficult not to mention that in terms of adoption or in terms of…

**[1:18:02] SPEAKER_00:** Maybe in terms of adoption and top-line features that one has and another doesn’t.

**[1:18:13] SPEAKER_01:** IPFS is widely used, also in Ethereum. It’s a good and relatively simple architecture, easy to understand compared to Swarm. It lacks privacy features as well as incentives. You can pin stuff, but pinning services are quite centralized and attackable. Filecoin does it in some way. It’s mainly good for archival and has killer features: availability proofs, proving data is available in replicas, which is not an obvious thing to do. It’s very good but… there’s a meme of someone taking a magnetic tape out saying someone retrieving stuff from Filecoin. If you don’t have a hot retrieval layer and some SLA, it’s difficult to evaluate. Since then there were tries and changes and attempts to link it to IPFS. Filecoin kind of does its job. It’s a bit of an overkill in terms of availability proofs and suffers issues: you have to negotiate the marketplace of storage. Swarm is very different: positive incentives. You get rewarded for storage that belongs to your neighborhood. Pricing and redistribution of postage stamp revenue is automatic. There’s no extra years for your file: chunks are distributed across many neighborhoods and node operators get rewarded for what belongs to them. This redistribution can have a central pricing property sensitive to supply signals, set the price based on a thermostat model. Whether it works and assumptions hold, pinch of salt. But in terms of bandwidth incentive, positive storage incentives, and privacy properties, it’s an advanced framework. Apart from content addressing, URL-based addressing, balanced distribution: symmetry. We take monetary incentives seriously: we model node operators as rational, profit-maximizing agents. Turn that into something usable on the network level: emergent intelligent system. That’s incentive design, and Ethereum is amazing at expressing incentive systems. We take it so seriously that decisions clients can make that violate protocol should not get better reward; at least you lose money. That’s from connectivity, how you connect, forward, serve, retrieve, cache: properly incentivized.

**[1:25:03] SPEAKER_00:** One last big question: looking back over these 10 years, have things happened as you thought they might? What you thought Ethereum was at the start, has that been what it’s become? What are your big reflections?

**[1:25:27] SPEAKER_01:** Ethereum is still very close to my heart. Beyond sentimental, I think it fulfills many early promises, and some are maturing slower than I would have wanted. Proof of Stake was supposed to come after a few years; it happened, but things take time to develop and conceptualize properly. For earlier ambitions—proper apps being on Swarm—didn’t materialize. I would say web3 app is as web3 as the weakest link. If anything is not decentralized in the stack… think of Tornado Cash but using Infura.

**[1:26:53] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[1:26:54] SPEAKER_01:** Infura did block Tornado Cash at the point and it was illegal to use in the US. We still suffer from early neglects: neglecting light clients, neglecting proofs and verification. It’s surprising. We talk about Web3 but it’s centralized. We talk NFTs and all this, but as Moxie Marlinspike put it, he showed when an OpenSea NFT turns into a third image. It’s fun to poke fun, we’re part of this. Some of these things might be a promise of Swarm or something we missed and lagging behind with ecosystem promises. But instead of lamenting, I try to share positive energies into constructive action. My approach is kind of solar punk: relatively optimistic about tech and the future. This unstoppability is unstoppable now. It’s not possible to slow it down. I really hope when people get it, they don’t look to stupid regulations curbing uses, and instead go for…

**[1:29:28] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, well, thanks so much and all the very best.

**[1:29:34] SPEAKER_01:** Okay, thank you very much, Bob. It was lovely to talk to you and reminisce about the past.

**[1:29:41] SPEAKER_00:** You too. Okay, thanks so much. Bye. Bye.
