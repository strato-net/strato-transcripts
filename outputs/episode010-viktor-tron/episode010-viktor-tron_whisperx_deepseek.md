**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** So hello, I am Bob Summerwill and this is Early Days of Ethereum with my good friend Viktor Trón. So hi Viktor, how are you?

**[00:05] SPEAKER_00:** Very very well, thank you. Hello Bob, thank you for inviting me to the show. It's wonderful.

**[00:10] SPEAKER_01:** Well great to have you here. So yeah, we bumped into each other in Buenos Aires for Devconnect and I'd hoped to record there but for one reason or another that never happened. So good to connect with you online instead. Talking about early days of Ethereum—you were very early in Ethereum. I mean, what were you doing in your life prior to that that led you to the project?

**[00:30] SPEAKER_00:** Not exactly. I wouldn't say I was very close to the crypto scene to be honest. I was working on a project with the BBC News Labs, basically a news juicer project. It was kind of trying to ingest a lot of news sources, like from old photo archives, video archives, and everything, and kind of juice it—basically work through the speech recognition and categorize it, making it searchable in a very nice way. Of course, it was one of these BBC-sponsored projects. No one really needed it. It was never really used, but it was a nice project to work on. And anyway, so I kind of left the job at that time.

**[01:08] SPEAKER_01:** You were in London? You were living in London?

**[01:10] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, I was in London. I was living in London. And I left the job because I found Ethereum. I was very excited right away. So when—I guess it was when Gavin visited this kind of New Web meetup, I'm sorry, I think it was a New Web meetup, and then presented Ethereum, I was absolutely taken aback and thought it was amazing and a game-changer. And I mean, what led me to it, to be honest, was already being quite into Bitcoin, which is kind of interesting. Because Bitcoin came into my life through a friend who I knew from an anarchist club, or anarchist Facebook group, basically. So he introduced me to it on ideological grounds. But of course, I was very interested in tech as well. But it took me quite a while to understand what blockchain was and how all these things come together. But by that time, I was kind of solid in understanding blockchain.

**[02:05] SPEAKER_01:** And so you mentioned your anarchist group there. Had Bitcoin earlier been interesting to you from that kind of monetary, anarchist, libertarian perspective?

**[02:15] SPEAKER_00:** I have to say yes. I mean, when Bitcoin came, this was the time when I even kind of learned what money was really. I mean, before I didn't even grasp this notion. And it was very important times in my life. It was really a game-changer to have a framework in which I could totally identify myself with. And yeah, libertarian—I don't know if it's the right word, but I really like this kind of Austrian view of economy. And I understood how our money was used and what inflation was. I never really understood before. It was okay. I came late to the game, let's say.

**[02:55] SPEAKER_01:** And the New Web meeting that you mentioned—was that a recurring meetup that you were going to regularly or was this a one-time thing?

**[03:00] SPEAKER_00:** No, yes, I was regularly going to web meetups, but this one particularly—I saw that because I’d already seen Vitalik’s presentation in Miami, so I knew what I was in for. And I went and showed up for that meeting in Houston Square, I think it was.

**[03:18] SPEAKER_01:** You said Vitalik’s presentation—was that the one he'd given in Miami?

**[03:20] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, exactly, Miami conference. And there was—so I kind of knew what to expect from it, but of course, I never really understood. Gavin helped me quite a bit to understand it, so it was really great.

**[03:33] SPEAKER_01:** Were you watching a variety of Bitcoin conference talks? Was that a regular thing you were doing at that point, watching YouTube?

**[03:40] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, at the time, I was very interested and very much into these things. I mean, I was hoping that changes related to these technologies would come a lot earlier. I was already careful—I was sold on the hype a bit or contributed to it myself in a way.

**[03:59] SPEAKER_01:** Had you been following along with things like MasterCoin and Colored Coins and other Bitcoin 2.0 projects?

**[04:05] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, actually I did. I think Counterparty was one, and there was Open Transactions, which was very close to Gavin’s heart. I think he worked with them together. And yeah, I don’t know what came after that, but it was interesting. And then after I left the BBC and spent the winter in Thailand, half in retreat and then in my spare time, I was working on the Yellow Paper, grinding my way through the really hard notation. Yes, a lot of people struggled with that sort of math-heavy notation.

**[04:42] SPEAKER_01:** And so you went to Gav’s presentation, which would have been very early February. So that was only like a week or so after Vitalik’s presentation in Miami—it would have been very close. So you spoke to Gav there and then you exchanged emails, did you?

**[04:55] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, basically, we exchanged emails. He put me on a Skype group. There was a Skype group at the time—I think it was 20-odd people on it, really. Not a big crowd. And yeah, that’s how it all started. Very nice in the beginning to discover grandiose ideas and chat and be part of it. I’m super proud and very happy that I managed to be at the beginning.

**[05:20] SPEAKER_01:** Was it a fair bit later in that year that you started working with Danny on Swarm?

**[05:25] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, it came a little bit later. First of all, in the spring, I started working on the Yellow Paper and then a bit on the C++ codebase, but not a lot. And then I think it was in March or sometime that I showed up to the first Ethereum meetup. Maybe not the first—you told me it was not the first, but the second one.

**[05:50] SPEAKER_01:** In London, this is?

**[05:52] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, yes, yes. This was organized by Stéphane Tuil. Stéphane Tuil was there. There was Michael there, who later came from Nakamoto X, I think. And then—

**[06:02] SPEAKER_01:** Michael was that—?

**[06:03] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, yes. And I think I talked quite a lot with Jack DeRose.

**[06:07] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, of Colony.

**[06:08] SPEAKER_00:** Colony fame, exactly. And that’s when I met Jeff first. Jeff became my boss later.

**[06:15] SPEAKER_01:** He came to London for that meetup?

**[06:17] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, he did. So I kind of saw that it was quite an international crowd, people from all over the world doing these things. So I started taking it very seriously. As I said, I left my job and joined the ranks. I started contributing to the Go code. After that, I was really into Golang—that’s where I contributed most and became part of the Go Ethereum team after Jeff offered me the job around September, October that year, when the foundation was already paying out some salaries or recruiting people on the teams.

**[07:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So I mean, I was looking at the timing on that. The Ethereum Foundation was founded in July 2014, and then the crowdsale went through July, August, September. And then, yeah, the hiring—that first wave of "we’ve actually got some money to hire people" was around September, October.

**[07:20] SPEAKER_00:** In October, I was negotiating with Aaron Buchanan, I remember.

**[07:25] SPEAKER_01:** Right, right.

**[07:26] SPEAKER_00:** And then, I don’t know when the Amsterdam office was actually funded, but I already visited Jeff later that year there. So when I first joined, I was talking with my summer friends in Hungary, some of them related to this Facebook group, and among them were Dalí, Fefe, and another person who was very close to Swarm later but never officially entered the scene. Let him be unnamed. So there was some thinking that maybe the four of us could form a group and join as a sub-dev team or something. It never happened, so we were just hired individually.

**[08:15] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, later that year there was Devcon Zero, is that correct?

**[08:20] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, that’s correct.

**[08:22] SPEAKER_01:** Right. If we just pop back a bit—through 2014, prior to the sale, how were things working early that year? You mentioned a Skype group—were most people kind of working through Skype?

**[08:35] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, yes, yes. It was really mainly everything was done by Gavin, Jeff, and the rest of us were just Sherpas on the way at the time. I'm talking about the technical stuff—I’m not sure about the admin and foundation stuff. So I hope no offense is taken from anyone. For tech stuff, it was July that Jeff shared a PoC (Proof of Concept) with me and introduced me to the intricacies of the then-aspiring devp2p protocol. So I think that was my first project that was really in the codebase that I wrote, which was later scraped and completely rewritten by Felix and some other guys. But that was my first attempt at the good-to-be networking layer.

**[09:30] SPEAKER_01:** Right. You’d mentioned the Yellow Paper. So in those early months of 2014, Gav in particular seemed incredibly productive in terms of what he was getting through with the C++ client and the Yellow Paper. Was it usually the code leading and the Yellow Paper being modeled after that?

**[09:50] SPEAKER_00:** It’s hard for me to say if they were developing hand-in-hand, but the productivity and the speed that Gav was churning out code was absolutely stunning. So within a few months, some of his clients already worked. Jeff was the same—he was also incredible in his productivity. Those people were really nice examples in front of me, so I was really happy to learn from them.

**[10:20] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that triangulation was so important—having multiple clients and the spec. You had the Python client too, though not really to production status. Those three groups were all—glorious, haha.

**[10:35] SPEAKER_00:** It’s a statement that Ethereum was very proud of—this multi-client development leading to very solid specs. It was actually true, but of course, that wasn’t the reason. The reason was all these brilliant individuals just followed their favorite language and wanted their own clients to be built. But hey, ultimately what came after it is amazing.

**[11:00] SPEAKER_01:** Talking to Jakub Czepluk—he was an intern at the Berlin office in 2015. He was telling me about a hard fork that happened on mainnet around two weeks after launch, which I was completely unaware of. But looking back, there was a security announcement by Utah—a patching of the client. While I’ve been doing stuff myself in terms of running old clients, I saw that as well. If you run 1.00 or Eth 1.01, it gets stuck—it can’t go through Frontier blocks. So it was actually a hard fork.

**[11:40] SPEAKER_00:** Do you remember what it was related to?

**[11:42] SPEAKER_01:** I mean, it was some kind of gas counting thing—just a little bug. But that was funny—something I wasn’t aware of.

**[11:50] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, things like that get forgotten over time.

**[11:53] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, so through that early 2014 year, you were working initially on the C++ client and then later on the Go client. How many people were working on Go in 2014?

**[12:05] SPEAKER_00:** It was really just a few people around. Jeff was mainly a designer, and Alex van de Sande from Brazil, and yeah—phew.

**[12:15] SPEAKER_01:** But you were the second team member then, is that right?

**[12:18] SPEAKER_00:** Correct, just about. Maybe actually the first officially, I’m not sure—the first paid one, I’m not sure. But we came roughly at the same time with Alex and Felix.

**[12:30] SPEAKER_01:** Right. Yeah, in terms of employment. But when you started working earlier—were there other people working on Go Ethereum ahead of your joining?

**[12:40] SPEAKER_00:** Not really, not really. So Jeff was pretty much the only one contributing, and I was among the ones that inspired him.

**[12:50] SPEAKER_01:** Nick Sabers is a name I’ve seen a lot but haven’t met or spoken to. He was around a lot early and then maybe disappeared—maybe a bit of an unknown guy.

**[13:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, he was never officially an Ethereum Foundation team member, but he was always around helping us. I think he was employed by some bank.

**[13:10] SPEAKER_01:** But I saw he and some others did the first continuous integration—they were doing the build system.

**[13:15] SPEAKER_00:** Nice.

**[13:16] SPEAKER_01:** And then he did work on the Java client as well.

**[13:20] SPEAKER_00:** That’s true. The Java client was mainly by Roman Mandalay, who mysteriously disappeared after a few years. I’m not sure what happened to him.

**[13:30] SPEAKER_01:** I did see him on Facebook for quite a time. He seems to have either disappeared or something since.

**[13:35] SPEAKER_00:** I remember talking to him at DEFCON Zero in London with the whole Ethereum Java team.

**[13:41] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, ETHCAMP, that’s correct.

**[13:45] SPEAKER_00:** Nostalgic. Yeah, it was early 2017 I think that he disappeared. They did Hacker Gold—some kind of hackathon where there was controversy. It looked like the team bought votes or something but were paid out anyway. Then he sort of disappeared with people thinking he exit scammed. I’m not convinced he did—if he did, it was the worst scam ever because it was so early.

**[14:15] SPEAKER_01:** You mentioned your collaborative sub-team—that’s EtherSphere, right?

**[14:20] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, it was kind of wishful thinking that EtherSphere would be a thing. I registered that as an organization on GitHub at least. I think at that time, it was only Aaron Injustice who was later Monax. They did some nice work. But Ethosphere was the home of most of our work, and then we committed through that to the codebase.

**[14:50] SPEAKER_01:** So that was yourself, Daniel Nagy, Zoltán Feffelé—

**[14:55] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, Zoltán Feffelé was already hired to work on the Light client in 2015. By DEFCON Zero, Danny and I were already part of the team.

**[15:10] SPEAKER_01:** So maybe could you say a bit about Swarm? My understanding is that some of the ideas went a long way back.

**[15:15] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. So I don’t know if you remember—in May 2014, there was a seminar of talks in Whitechapel somewhere in East London. In that talk, it was the first appearance of Web3 in the Ethereum context.

**[15:35] SPEAKER_01:** Again, some meetups—was it?

**[15:37] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, yes. And I think Vitalik even had some co-working space there.

**[15:42] SPEAKER_01:** Would that have been when that famous diagram first surfaced—the one with the circle and apps coming in at the side?

**[15:47] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, that was just about that time.

**[15:50] SPEAKER_01:** Including QML, I saw—so it wasn’t just HTML.

**[15:54] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, that’s when Web3 was born.

**[15:57] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, the thorn symbol—

**[16:00] SPEAKER_00:** Exactly. And that’s when these subprotocols were invented—metaphorics, gimmicks—these subprotocols running on a common basis, with Ethereum being just one of many related protocols.

**[16:15] SPEAKER_01:** And Zoltán mentioned to me that he thought the idea for Swarm had gone back to at least 2011?

**[16:20] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, so there was this idea—BitTorrent had drawbacks, like difficulty starting downloads and improper incentives to keep data. Dani saw these problems and tried to solve them with a decentralized storage system.

**[16:40] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, I didn’t know BitTorrent had legal issues in Germany.

**[16:43] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, much later. So Dani was trying to give an idea of how to chunk things—every chunk being content addressable. Normally, a DHT (Distributed Hash Table) puts node IDs and chunk IDs in the same space, so you get information about who to download from.

**[17:10] SPEAKER_01:** Swarm is still fascinating—the idea of decentralized storage and incentivization.

**[17:15] SPEAKER_00:** Absolutely. Swarm was meant to solve problems like censorship and data availability.

**[17:20] SPEAKER_01:** And I mean, the holy trinity—compute, storage, and messaging—was always a compelling vision.

**[17:25] SPEAKER_00:** Exactly. That’s what Swarm aimed to achieve. It’s still relevant today.

**[17:30] SPEAKER_01:** Thanks so much for sharing these memories. It’s been great talking to you.

**[17:35] SPEAKER_00:** Thank you, Bob. It’s been wonderful reminiscing about the early days.

**[17:40] SPEAKER_01:** Bye-bye.

**[17:41] SPEAKER_00:** Bye-bye.
