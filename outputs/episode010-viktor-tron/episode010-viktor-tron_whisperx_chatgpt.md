**[00:03] SPEAKER_01:** So hello, I am Bob Summerwill, and this is Early Days of Ethereum with my good friend Viktor Trón. So hi Viktor, how are you?

**[00:03] SPEAKER_01:** Very, very well, thank you. Hello Bob, thank you for inviting me to the show.

**[00:03] SPEAKER_01:** It’s wonderful.

**[00:03] SPEAKER_01:** Great to have you here. So yeah, we bumped into each other in Buenos Aires for Devcon, and I’d hoped to record there, but for one reason or another that never happened. So good to connect you online instead. So, talking about early days of Ethereum: you were very early in Ethereum. What were you doing in your life prior to that, that led you to the project? And then work-wise I was a—

**[01:00] SPEAKER_00:** Not exactly. I wouldn't say I was exactly very close to the crypto scene, to be honest. I was working on a project with the BBC News Labs, basically a “NewsJuicer” project. It was kind of trying to ingest a lot of news sources, like from old photo archives, video archives, and everything, and kind of “juice” it: basically work through the speech recognition and everything, categorize it, and we made it searchable in a very nice way. I mean, of course it’s one of these kind of BBC-sponsored projects. No one really needed them. It was never really used, but it was a nice project to work on. And anyway, so I kind of left the job at that time.

**[01:53] SPEAKER_01:** You were in London? You were living in London?

**[01:56] SPEAKER_00:** So yeah, I was in London. I was living in London. And I left the job because I found Ethereum. I was very excited right away. So I guess it was when Gavin visited this kind of “New Web” meetup—I’m sorry, I think it was a New Web meetup—and then presented Ethereum. I was absolutely taken aback, and I thought it was amazing and a game-changer. And what led me to it, to be honest, I was already quite a bit into Bitcoin, which is kind of interesting, because Bitcoin came into my life through a friend who I knew from an anarchist club, or anarchist Facebook group, basically. So he introduced me to it on ideological grounds. But of course, I was very interested in tech as well. But it took me quite a while to understand what blockchain is, how all these things come together. But by that time I was kind of solid in understanding the blockchain, and my mental model was solid enough so that I could question Gavin and then Vitalik, and say “that is absolutely not going to work, obviously, because of this whole thing problem.” And bit by bit, when I understood that they all had answers to every question that I could ever think of, then that’s when I got convinced that they’re probably the geniuses I really want to look up to and have in my biography to learn from. It was a very, very, very great start. And so when Gavin presented Ethereum, next day I was already hacking on the C++ codebase actually, and had my first PR in. We met in a cafe in Dalston, I think. I remember it was quite impressive that I learned how to use Mac, but actually was running Linux OS on it. It was very impressive already.

**[04:26] SPEAKER_01:** And you mentioned your anarchist group there. Had Bitcoin earlier been interesting to you from that kind of monetary, anarchist, libertarian angle?

**[04:46] SPEAKER_00:** I have to say yes. I have to say yes. When Bitcoin came, this was the time when I kind of learned what money was really. Before, I didn’t even grasp this notion. And it was very important times in my life. It was really a game-changer to have a framework in which I could totally identify myself with. And yeah, libertarian, I don't know if it's the right word, but I really like this kind of Austrian view of economy. And I have understood how our money was used and what inflation was. I never really understood before. It was okay. I came late to the game, let’s say. Let’s say that. But yeah. And then it was all very—

**[05:45] SPEAKER_01:** And the Next Web meeting that you mentioned, was that like a recurring meetup that you were going to, or were you regularly going to kind of web meetups? Yes, but this one particularly—I saw that because I saw Vitalik’s presentation in Miami and so—

**[06:13] SPEAKER_00:** So that really got me interested, so I knew what I was in for, and I went and showed up for that meeting in Hoxton Square, I think it was, that meeting.

**[06:22] SPEAKER_01:** Sorry, you said Vitalik’s presentation—was that the one that he’d given in Miami?

**[06:28] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, exactly, Miami conference. And there was a—so I knew already what to expect from it, but of course I never really understood, and Gavin helped me quite a bit to understand it. So it was really great.

**[06:44] SPEAKER_01:** Were you watching a variety of Bitcoin conference talks? Was that a regular thing that you were doing at that point, watching YouTube?

**[06:56] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, at the time I was very, very interested and very much into these things. I was hoping that changes related to this kind of technologies would come a lot earlier. I was sold in the hype a bit, or contributed to it myself in a way.

**[07:21] SPEAKER_01:** Had you been following along with things like Mastercoin and Colored Coins and other sort of “Bitcoin 2.0” projects?

**[07:31] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, actually I did, yeah. I think it would be “Shares” at the point—I’m sorry—and there was BitShares, I think. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And then there was this kind of—and then Open Transactions, which was very close to Gavin’s heart I think, worked together. And I don’t know what came after that, after all, but interesting. And then after I left the BBC and running that, I spent winter half in Thailand, half in the retreat, and then in my spare time I was working on the Yellow Paper, and working my way through the really hard notation, and getting put in the paper, yes. A lot of people struggled with that sort of math-heavy notation.

**[08:34] SPEAKER_01:** And so you went to Gav’s presentation, which would have been very early February. That was only like a week or so after Vitalik’s presentation in Miami. It would have been very, very close. So you spoke to Gav there and then you exchanged emails, did you?

**[08:56] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, basically, we exchanged emails. He put me on a Skype group. There was a Skype group at the time. I think it was 20-odd people on it, really, so not a big crowd. And yeah, that’s how it all started. So very nice in the beginning to discover really grandiose ideas and chat and be part of it. I’m super proud and very happy that I managed to be at the—

**[09:29] SPEAKER_01:** Year nearly. It’s kind of a lucky move, to be honest. So was it a fair bit later in that year that you started working with Dani on Swarm, or were you doing—

**[09:46] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, then it came a little bit later. So yes, first of all, in the spring, I started working on the Yellow Paper and then a bit on the C++, but not a lot. And then I think it was in March or sometime that I showed up on the first Ethereum meetup. Maybe not the first. I think you told me it was not the first, but the second one.

**[10:10] SPEAKER_01:** In London, this is?

**[10:12] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, yes, yes.

**[10:13] SPEAKER_01:** So this was organized by Stéphane Tual.

**[10:16] SPEAKER_00:** Stéphane Tual there. There was Michael there, who later came from Akasha, I think. And then—

**[10:28] SPEAKER_01:** Sorry, Michael was that, right?

**[10:31] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, yes. And I think who I talked to quite a lot was Jack du Rose.

**[10:37] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, of Colony.

**[10:39] SPEAKER_00:** Colony fame, exactly. And then there is when I met Jeff first. Jeff became my boss later.

**[10:48] SPEAKER_01:** He came to London for that meetup?

**[10:50] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, yes, he did. And so I kind of saw that it’s quite an international crowd, from all over the world kind of doing these things. So I started to take it very seriously. As I said, I kind of left my job and then joined the ranks. And I kind of started contributing to the Go code. And so after that, I was really into Go. That’s where I contributed most and became part of the Go Ethereum team after Jeff offered me the job around September, October that year, when the Foundation was already actually paying out some salaries or recruiting people on the teams.

**[11:42] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I was looking at the timing on that. So the Ethereum Foundation was founded in July of 2014, and then the crowdsale was going through July, August, September. And then the hiring, that first wave of “we’ve actually got some money to hire people,” was September, October.

**[12:11] SPEAKER_00:** In October, I was negotiating with Aeron Buchanan, I remember.

**[12:17] SPEAKER_01:** Right, right.

**[12:19] SPEAKER_00:** My contact then. And then I don’t know when the Amsterdam office was actually funded, but I already visited Jeff, I think later in that year there. So when I first kind of joined, I was talking to my friends in Hungary, some of them related to this Facebook group, and among them like Dani, Fefe, and there was another person who was very close to Swarm later, but never actually entered the scene officially—let him be unnamed. And so there was some thinking that maybe the four of us can form a group, and we can just join as a kind of sub-dev team or something. It never happened. So we were just hired individually. Yes, later that year there was Devcon Zero, is that correct?

**[13:22] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah. If we just pop back a little bit: through 2014, prior to the sale and so on, how were things working early in 2014? You mentioned a Skype group. Were most people kind of working through Skype?

**[13:50] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, yes, yes. It was really mainly everything was done by Gavin, Jeff, and the rest of us were just sherpas on the way at the time, just tapping out. I’m talking about the technical stuff. I’m really not sure about the admin and the Foundation stuff, so I hope no offense is taken from anyone. But yeah, for tech stuff, yes. So I think it was actually already in July that Jeff shared a kind of “to-do” with me and introduced me to the intricacies of the then aspiring devp2p protocol. And so I think that was my first project, I think, that was really kind of in the codebase that I wrote, which was then later scrapped and completely rewritten by Felix and some of the other guys. But that was my first attempt, I think, at the Go Ethereum networking layer. At the time, I was kind of trying to say really crazy ideas to Jeff about some developer tooling, like contract verification, and like staging and like fake blockchain environments and stuff. And there was other things to do, and it was focusing on the end-user applications. At the time, I think it was on the—well it was actually late in the Mist browser business.

**[15:53] SPEAKER_01:** Right.

**[15:54] SPEAKER_00:** It was a browser. And so he was kind of trying to talk me out of it and said that the other group, the C++ team, is assigned to that anyway. So let me not tread on unwanted paths. And so he kind of brought me back to—well, I mean, you had AlethZero, right? AlethZero, I guess, with an earlier kind of incarnation of that. Yeah, that’s good. But then there was some not-so-glorious tasks as well at the time: refactor logging and things like this, I remember in the early days. But there was also a time when I was really learning Go, because that was also not a super popular language. There was a lot of learning to do.

**[16:52] SPEAKER_01:** It was relatively new at that point. You’d mentioned the Yellow Paper. So in those very early months of 2014, Gav in particular seemed to be incredibly productive in terms of what he was getting through with the C++ client and the Yellow Paper. Was it usually the code that was leading and then the Yellow Paper was being modeled after that?

**[17:28] SPEAKER_00:** It’s hard for me to say if they really were that kind of hand-in-hand developing. I can’t really tell; maybe it’s better to ask him, to be honest. But yes, the productivity and actually the speed that he was churning out code, absolutely stunning. It’s like a few months after, some of his clients already worked. Yeah. To be honest, Jeff was the same, and Jeff was also incredible in his productivity. And those people were really a nice example in front of me. So I was really happy to learn from them.

**[18:12] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. And I think that triangulation was so important, right, of having multiple clients and the spec. And you had the PyEthereum client—though not really to that production status. But those three groups all—

**[18:32] SPEAKER_00:** This statement that Ethereum was very proud of, like this multi-client development was leading to very, very solid specs, it was actually true. But of course, that was not the reason; the reason was that all these brilliant individuals just followed their own favorite language and just wanted their own clients to be built. But ultimately what came after it is amazing. The specification was really— I just remember a few times that the specification had to be changed. There’s one case when there’s a modulo operation that was not good, not exactly—it's a minus number, I'm not sure exactly. There was another one when I think it was around Easter 2015, or something, before, in the year leading to the launch. And I think that was when it’s kind of a problem that the “uncles” had the same timestamp, I think. And that led to a fork. I remember I wrote a kind of blog post about it. Never published it, so it’s interesting.

**[19:54] SPEAKER_01:** Talking to Jakub Czepluch, so he was an intern at the Berlin office in 2015, but he was telling me about a hard fork that had happened on Mainnet around two weeks or so after launch, which I was completely unaware of. But then looking back, there was a sort of security announcement, a patching of the client. And while I’ve been doing stuff myself in terms of running old clients, I saw that as well. If you run 1.0.0, or geth 1.0.1, it gets stuck. It can’t go through Frontier blocks. So it was actually a hard fork.

**[20:53] SPEAKER_00:** Do you remember what it was related to? It was not that interesting that you remembered.

**[20:59] SPEAKER_01:** It was some kind of gas counting or something, just some kind of little bug. But that was funny. That was a thing that I was not aware about, because it was a hard fork, but it was never given a name because it was just an accident. And you wonder how many more of these little things there were that happened that are sort of forgotten in the midst of time. But yeah. Through that early 2014 year, you were working initially on the C++ and then later on the Go. How many people were working on Go in 2014?

**[22:00] SPEAKER_00:** It was really just a few people around. Jeff, I think, was mainly a designer, and Alex van de Sande from Brazil, and yeah, and phew—

**[22:19] SPEAKER_01:** But you were the second team member then, is that right?

**[22:24] SPEAKER_00:** Correct, just about. Maybe actually the first officially, I’m not sure. The first paid one, I’m not sure. But we came roughly at the same time with Alex and I think with Felix.

**[22:37] SPEAKER_01:** Right. Yeah, in terms of employment. But I meant when you were working earlier, when you started there. Were there other people working on that Go Ethereum ahead of your joining in with him?

**[22:53] SPEAKER_00:** Not really, not really. So I was pretty much among the ones that contributed and the core that inspired him. And there was quite a vibrant ecosystem, like a vibrant community of people making—the data became slow. It was like Nick Szabo around, super tall little dude. And we were going together to the Bitcoin conference, I think it was in April.

**[23:27] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Oh, you went to Toronto.

**[23:29] SPEAKER_00:** No, no, it was in Amsterdam.

**[23:31] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, okay.

**[23:33] SPEAKER_00:** And that’s when I really talked to Vitalik quite a bit. It was very nice. And I got a big party this month, so it was a nice time. It was a nice time.

**[23:52] SPEAKER_01:** Nick Szabo is a name that I’ve seen a lot of times, and I’ve never really met or spoken to him. I guess he was around a lot early and then maybe kind of disappeared out. Maybe he’s a little bit of an unknown guy that doesn’t show his face.

**[24:21] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I mean he never joined. I don't think he was ever an official dev team, but he was always around and helping us. I think he was employed by some bank.

**[24:30] SPEAKER_01:** But I saw he and some others did the first continuous integration. They were doing the build system.

**[24:39] SPEAKER_00:** Nice, nice.

**[24:41] SPEAKER_01:** And then he did work on the Java client as well.

**[24:44] SPEAKER_00:** That is true. And the Java client was mainly by—what was his name?

**[24:52] SPEAKER_01:** Roman Mandeleil.

**[24:53] SPEAKER_00:** It’s correct, Roman Mandeleil, who kind of mysteriously disappeared after a few years. I’m not sure what happened to him.

**[25:03] SPEAKER_01:** I did see him on Facebook for quite a time. He seems to have either disappeared or something since.

**[25:11] SPEAKER_00:** I remember I still talked to him at the London Devcon, Devcon One, definitely around there with the whole EthereumJ team. I don’t know what their name was, but EtherCamp, that’s correct. Okay, thanks for reminding us. Well, nostalgic. So yeah, it was early 2017, I think, that he kind of disappeared. They did “Hacker Gold” and there was some kind of hackathon that there was some controversy about. It looked like the team kind of bought votes or something, but were paid out anyway. And then yeah, he sort of disappeared with some people thinking he’d exit-scammed. I’m not convinced he did, because if he did, it was the worst exit scam ever because it was so early. It wasn’t like anyone had got any kind of big amount of money or anything at that point. It was sort of a very poor scam.

**[26:20] SPEAKER_00:** He was definitely a man of principles. So maybe. So you’d mentioned about your collaborative sort of sub-team. That’s Ethersphere. It was wishful thinking that might be Ethersphere, but on the other hand I did register that as an organization on GitHub at least, and even made—yeah. I think it was pretty much the—anyway, if I could call it a brand. At that time, it was only Aeron Buchanan who was—

**[27:07] SPEAKER_01:** Right, yeah, Harris.

**[27:11] SPEAKER_00:** Who later became Monax. This is Marmot, Marmot. They did some nice work, by the way. But yes, Ethersphere was the home of maybe most of our work, and then you can commit through that to the codebase.

**[27:32] SPEAKER_01:** So that was yourself, Daniel Nagy, Zolt Felföldi?

**[27:41] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, Zolt Felföldi. I was already hired to work on the light client. I think it was 2015 already. And yeah, because he was not on Devcon Zero. But yeah, Devcon Zero was already confirmed and it’s where I saw Dani and me joining. By that time, there was quite a bit of Barcelona with him, I think.

**[28:08] SPEAKER_01:** So maybe could you say a bit about Swarm? Because my understanding is that some of the ideas go an awful long way back.

**[28:20] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. I don’t know if you remember, there was in May 2014, there was a seminar, a trail of talks in, I think it was in Whitechapel somewhere, or somewhere in East London. And in that talk, that was the first appearance of Web3 in the scene, in the Ethereum context. There was, like, memories usually explained, and the founders really realized how decentralization can basically also be extended then to support the entire backend of the entire web. And basically, if you extend it to the data, app data, and then hosting, and to basically put the data layer on top, and then maybe the messaging, then you can conceive of it as the world computer with this holy trinity of: you can see the Ethereum blockchain as the world computer’s CPU, and then the hard disk would be Swarm, and then Whisper would be the messaging layer.

**[29:45] SPEAKER_01:** You were mentioning Whitechapel. So that was again some meetups?

**[29:47] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, yes. And I think maybe they even had some sort of co-working or some sort of high-end office there, maybe a room or two, because we often found Vitalik there. So I’m not entirely sure how this worked out. I don’t want to say anything. There were a lot of internal meetings as well.

**[30:15] SPEAKER_01:** Would that have been when that kind of famous diagram would first have surfaced? The one with the circle and the apps coming in at the side?

**[30:27] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, that was just about that time, yeah.

**[30:31] SPEAKER_01:** Including QML, I saw. So it was not just HTML. It was QML and Qt as other anticipated tech platforms.

**[30:45] SPEAKER_00:** Yes. So that’s when Web3 was born. It’s kind of the crazy protocol names after the ETH, which is also kind of this letter in Icelandic.

**[31:04] SPEAKER_01:** Oh yeah, the thorn.

**[31:06] UNKNOWN:** Yeah.

**[31:06] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, exactly. And so then that’s when this—and then was invented also, Vitalik’s gimmicks: those Ethereum subprotocols, right? Protocols running on a common basis, but Ethereum was just one of many related protocols.

**[31:32] SPEAKER_00:** And that’s where I was very dedicated to this whole Ethereum at the time. I really understood what it means to have the entire kind of Turing-complete computation being secured on its own with the blockchain. And I envisioned quite a change in how the internet works if you have Swarm and then Whisper and all these things. So I quite liked the idea. And then later I learned that not only did they socialize on BitTorrent at the time, but actually some of us, like Dani, operating a DC++ node, had some legal troubles. Maybe we can also talk about this with him at some point. So that brought us quite directly in the realm of implementing Swarm: this idea of decentralized storage and maybe incentivization, etc., and a neighbor solution on Ethereum. It’s a little connected.

**[32:44] SPEAKER_01:** And Zoltan mentioned to me that he thought that the idea for Swarm had gone back to at least 2011?

**[32:55] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, so there was this idea of—I mean, of course, I don’t know about that, but it was mainly done in his idea that he saw the amazing works of BitTorrent, they also saw some drawbacks. So maybe historically it's best to derive the whole idea of Swarm from there. Because BitTorrent had difficulty starting a download because of all these throttling moves, and of course didn’t have the proper incentives to keep the data. And also, of course, had the problem with the individual bits of the file not being addressable right away. You had to use a tracker to resolve them. And of course, that’s also a problem with the legal balance. Because, as you remember, for example in Germany, there was legal prosecution for who used torrent.

**[34:26] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, I didn’t know that.

**[34:27] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, not that time, but much later. So I think what Dani was trying to do is give up an idea of how to chunk things in a way every chunk is kind of content-addressable. And also, that some of the placement of chunks is also part of the DHT. So normally a DHT, like a distributed hash table, is basically the idea that you put node IDs and then kind of chunk IDs, or ideas of content basically, in the same space, and somehow you get information with location, like who to download it from, about these body chunks from the neighborhoods that have the same address or similar address. There’s usually a metric on this. And if you use the logarithmic distance like that, then you can work with Kademlia, and then it’s going to mean that works: you can iterate through the peers, like you keep a few peers connected, and you go in a whole way. So you ask, “Do you know a closer one to this guy, to this guy?” And when this guy is like the hash of Star Wars, and you want to watch Star Wars, then you call him up, and ultimately you see where the chunks are and download them from. So obviously this is not very private, and it’s also not really deniable. So if you enforce that certain chunks should reside—you enforce a kind of storage layer on top of it—then you can possibly deny that you know anything about it. It’s just a system that enforces that parts of Star Wars reside. So basically, it was done as a genius idea that I think we called the DPA, Decentralized Preimage Archive. It’s basically an archive of preimages. Preimage is a piece of data that the image of which is the hash. The preimage is what’s before the hashing, the actual piece of data. And so this idea of storing not the location but the actual data at the place in the DHT, has direct DHT interpretation, was the DPA. And that was a very important notion that came and then became very important in Swarm. And then a lot of other things came. So I remember when we were in 2015 or 2014, I’m not sure, and in the winter, we were sitting in the Arena Plaza in Budapest, the three of us, with Fefe, talking about this and how to start implementing it. Because there was pressure to implement the whole thing using UDP as the networking stack because it was considered TCP is too heavy and too slow. But at the time you already had the devp2p protocol, it’s very easy to implement and then try this protocol. So I suggested we should, instead of using UDP, just use TCP, but use it for forwarding: keep alive some connections, permanent connections with the peers, and just use the Kademlia through the live connections that each forwarding locally decide to forward to the closer node, and ultimately backward: if you forward the request, you backward the chunk. And it seemed very easy to implement, and we did exactly that. It turned out to be one of the best and most interesting choices of Swarm. It turns out that that’s what allows peer-to-peer accounting to be working, and also gives the privacy features that Swarm has. Basically, the originator of the request: no one knows that when someone is asking you something, that they want to watch Star Wars, or someone upstream wants to watch Star Wars. Also, it directly solved the opportunistic caching problem, how to distribute automatically popular content: retrieval paths, all the forwarding peers can just remember some chunks. It’s very interesting how these ideas started. And then basically we coalesced in 2016. I think the very first release of Swarm within geth 1.5—he was in—I’m not sure of the—one second. It was December 2016. Yes. And this alpha public pilot was released. And I remember there was already kind of how we viewed video. We called it streaming, but it’s not video streaming, it’s just the video file. There were nice tweets about that too.

**[40:50] SPEAKER_01:** And just to take a step back: my understanding of a primary thought with Swarm was that because you could have this holy trinity, right, of decentralized compute/database—the blockchain—Swarm for the decentralized filesystem and storage, and then Whisper for decentralized messaging, you could have this really nice synergy. A primary issue which is still really not solved is how do you host the web front end, right? You need your smart contracts and your transactions and things, but you need an application wrapping around that. So the thought that if you had a decentralized storage mechanism that could store the HTML and the JavaScript and so on, that you want an incentive system so that that stuff is available if people want it, that you don't have a tragedy of the commons where only the most popular content is available. But also, because if you’re building on Ethereum, you’ve got the cryptocurrency to do the incentives. You’ve got the smart contract system that allows you to implement those incentive systems. And all of these things can fit together into a holistic, unstoppable whole, right, of saying: here you go, you’ve got your applications which cannot be stopped, but that’s the full stack. And it seems even now that there’s an awful lot of stuff which is dependent on centralized hosted services. It’s very central.

**[42:52] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, I am pretty sad about this, to be honest. I mean, there’s a lot of these things. I don’t know if you remember this big—I don’t know, was it Bitbase?—that kind of lost the biggest crypto heist ever because of the Safe. If that had been using Swarm, then it would be much more difficult to change all these transactions under the hood, because they had to—what they had to do is hack the person’s, the dev’s account, and then upload something through S3, which then made the Safe wallet use it. And of course, these are much more difficult to do if these things are content-addressed. This is how these things work: you start from the blockchain, you start seeing the source of truth, ENS or services as a name. You resolve it to a content hash, and then the content hash is retrieved from the Swarm, from these decentralized stores.

**[44:06] SPEAKER_01:** And again, that 2016 era was when ENS was coming to life as well. So yeah, that’s another important part.

**[44:15] SPEAKER_00:** Actually, Nick Johnson was first part of the Swarm team. As part of the Swarm team, he developed ENS, and then later took off and pivoted to ENS.

**[44:29] SPEAKER_01:** I didn’t know he worked on Swarm. I knew he was part of the geth team, but he did some Swarm as well, eh?

**[44:37] SPEAKER_00:** Well, definitely. I recruited him, to be honest.

**[44:41] SPEAKER_01:** Fantastic. Did you know him in London?

**[44:45] SPEAKER_00:** No, no, no. He was just part of the community. He was a very valuable contribution to the community. Yeah, to Swarm.

**[44:58] SPEAKER_01:** Let me just check the timeline. But I think he got hired really pretty soon after me. I started in February 2016, and I think he was maybe June. Same kind of time as Hudson. Let’s see. So yeah, I started in February. Greg Colvin in March. Everton Fraga in April. And yeah, June: both Hudson and Jamie Pitts and Nick Johnson. All June 2016. What was I going to mention? So yeah, you talked about Devcon Zero. That was November 2014 in Berlin. Was that the first time that you met quite a number of these people?

**[46:08] SPEAKER_00:** Absolutely. Actually, yeah. Especially memorable is my meeting with Alex Leverington.

**[46:16] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, yes.

**[46:17] SPEAKER_00:** “devp2p” fame. Yeah. Interesting. We had lots of discussions. He was very adamant and very stubborn with his own way of thinking about the protocol. I have to say he was much more knowledgeable than I was at the time, so I was trying to learn a lot from him. But at the same time, I was looking at how he was trying to be a bit more pragmatic and trying to be savvy, and then I had to simplify. And I remember, at first, basically brought together the specs for the protocol, and then that was not really followed. It was a very interesting time.

**[47:06] SPEAKER_01:** The other piece there is that libp2p—as part of Protocol Labs, IPFS—that already existed at that time. So that was kind of interesting, right? This whole devp2p, libp2p.

**[47:23] SPEAKER_00:** You know how Ethereum kind of suffers from this kind of—what’s the word for this?

**[47:31] SPEAKER_01:** Not invented here syndrome.

**[47:33] SPEAKER_00:** Thank you. Like, you know, the RLPx stuff, right? Then we have that one on a serialization protocol like devp2p as well. I have to say that devp2p at some point was pretty kind of lean—

**[47:56] SPEAKER_01:** Right.

**[47:57] SPEAKER_00:** Excellent. For the purposes of including it in Swarm, for example, it’s a lot less bloated. But of course it had a lot of problems in terms of maintenance. It’s just not appropriate to start like that and build everything from scratch. In retrospect, it was probably not the best idea, to be honest. But hey.

**[48:21] SPEAKER_01:** And that’s got stuck in the execution clients forever. The consensus clients now are using libp2p and aren’t using RLP anymore, but the execution client got stuck with devp2p forever. And I remember having discussions with various people on this in 2016 of saying, well, could you have both protocols? People looking at, could you do a bridge protocol so that some of the stuff could run over libp2p, and you can have relay nodes? Really with the thought that with libp2p you could run in a browser, right? Devp2p you could never run in a browser. And I was working with somebody from the Parity team, maybe Robert, around maybe a little later, 2017, 2018, trying to see: can we get a light client in-browser talking to all of these things? But it never quite happened. Some of these decisions just last forever.

**[49:43] SPEAKER_00:** It was only after Swarm left the Foundation that we switched to libp2p as well. We started a big client development.

**[49:53] SPEAKER_01:** Right, right. I wasn’t aware that that transition had happened. So Devcon Zero, late 2014, but things continued through 2015 all the way up to the July launch.

**[50:15] SPEAKER_00:** At the time, Swarm was just an idea which was mainly meant to be specced out, and was started by Dani, who had this very interesting peer-to-peer storage, and he actually presented his vision of that at Devcon Zero. Very good early capturing on this idea.

**[50:45] SPEAKER_01:** And at that point he got hired in, and that became a real thread of official development within the Ethereum stack—

**[50:50] SPEAKER_00:** And then slowly, organically, became a little bit of a sub-team after that. And so after that, Fefe never really contributed. It was the first big change. I think he was even programmer before it still came.

**[51:33] SPEAKER_01:** He was telling me that he was thinking that was what he would be doing when he was hired in.

**[51:41] SPEAKER_00:** But then almost immediately Jeff told him, “Yeah, no you’re not. You’re just working on gas.” Yes. I mean, we have inside for developing the incentivized light client protocol. He worked on it for many, many years. And it’s a bit sad that it never took off, but yeah, it’s tough.

**[52:09] SPEAKER_01:** That’s where my own journey started. When I got interested in Ethereum, the first thing I wanted to do: I was really into mobile and wearables at that time. So I wanted to see, can I run an Ethereum node on my smartwatch? So I was doing ARM Linux cross-builds of cpp-ethereum. And my thought at that time was: okay, light client is still getting worked out, but I’ll get a full client working on all these devices. And then when light client comes out, they’ll just work, right? So I can run a full client on a testnet, make sure it all works. But it’s just a matter of time. Of course we’ll have light clients and of course everything will scale. Of course you can run all things on any devices, right? We’re thinking every phone is going to have an Ethereum node running, every router, media box.

**[53:15] SPEAKER_00:** And we’re still suffering the kind of RPC and centralized access, right?

**[53:21] SPEAKER_01:** How unstoppable is that? It will just come with every Linux distro, it will just be like a service that’s part of the Linux distro, shipped. You’ve got this background service that is just talking Ethereum. It’d be the same as having a network stack or an audio stack or whatever. It’s just like, yeah, you’re going to have a consensus stack and it’ll just run in the background and just work. Cheap and easy. Yeah. Not quite happen.

**[53:55] SPEAKER_00:** Ten years in, it’s kind of made me—these things are starting. I don’t know if you know the “dBoot” project, for example.

**[54:12] SPEAKER_01:** No, what’s that?

**[54:14] SPEAKER_00:** How to boot from Swarm. Yes. They’re building a UEFI client that can bring up any operating system.

**[54:31] SPEAKER_01:** Okay, that’s interesting.

**[54:33] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, interesting. It’s not worked out fully yet, but the guys are really—

**[54:42] SPEAKER_01:** There’s a fair bit of networking stuff that would have to happen before you could even start, right? Like bootstrapping, a little mini OS or something.

**[54:57] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. And it seems that even before that you can do it.

**[55:15] SPEAKER_01:** Through those early years prior to Mainnet launch, you’d mentioned work on the Yellow Paper. How was it being determined what “feature complete,” what “good enough” looks like? Had you got a good idea of what you’d have to have before launch could happen?

**[55:49] SPEAKER_00:** I didn’t have a clear idea, really, because it took me a while to understand the full system. I’m very honest with you. I think it’s only Jeff who really opened it up, where he already knew what was needed to be built. And he was building massive things on his own, single-handedly. It’s really crazy. Not so good experience, but I was assigned the task of building the block pool, which was supposed to be the one that takes the blocks from the other clients, builds up the header chain, and validates it, etc. And I was working a lot on that, and every time he had enough and said, “Okay, I just build it,” and basically one or two days and it was done. And it was an interesting experience.

**[56:55] SPEAKER_01:** And Christoph Jentz was building the cross-client tests as well. Did you do work with those tests yourselves?

**[57:07] SPEAKER_00:** No, I didn’t, but yeah, I remember he was always running. So I remember.

**[57:27] SPEAKER_01:** In July 2015 we had the arrival of Ming Chan, and shortly afterwards pretty serious budget cuts, because within that year or so the Foundation had managed to burn through the vast majority of the money. “Austerity” I think was the official name of that.

**[57:56] SPEAKER_00:** And that time when Vitalik basically said that “of course it’s not going to be Swarm,” what’s going to be is maybe if you just use IPFS and start to work on the incentive system that we can put on that. And I remember that—maybe it’s not a secret anymore—but Jeff kind of let us keep working on Swarm through this period. So we did. And there was a basically ready incentivization scheme for the bandwidth incentives. It’s also very interesting because Swarm seems to be one of the only internet storage systems that has a proper bandwidth incentive and a proper accounting system, like this debit accounting system. It seems quite—probably conjecture, but it doesn’t look like there’s any other proper way to do this. Because if you think about bandwidth: first of all it’s a kind of instant gratification thing. You can write a forward for someone, like you forward a request or not. So it’s not like the shady territory of a future promise like storage: you have to record your deal on-chain and have proof of availability, etc. But here bandwidth is just much more immediate. Swarm solved it by peer-to-peer accounting: I forward for you, you forward for me, and then we just relay for each other, and if there’s a big tilt then some sort of quantization should happen. I’m not sure; maybe it doesn’t even have to be some settlement around it. And then maybe we like this idea that is genius, that came up in this checkbook idea. It’s basically an early version of a payment channel-like micropayment solution. And yeah, so that bandwidth incentive was a very powerful one. It lived on. And then I remember the incentivization for storage was much more difficult to arrive at: the negative incentives, how to solve the problem of pricing and growth and who’s responsible for what. And if it’s everything recorded on-chain, how to attend the privacy of things. It’s very, very difficult. So it came much, much later. I worked out that part as well. It was only after the token—Swarm token—was released in 2021. Yeah. Well anyway. So yeah, going back to the roots, the austerities—

**[1:01:27] SPEAKER_01:** So you were continuing to work through late 2015 even though it had supposedly been defunded?

**[1:01:36] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, kind of, yes. We were trying to figure out this incentive, and in that sense we were off track in a way. And I was also working at the time on the Ethereum client, on many aspects of it. And by 2017, the kind of Swarm client was integrated and that was released within Ethereum. It was in 2018 when it’s kind of the “Concept Three” release was part of geth. And then it’s kind of when the Swarm client was starting out: it started as a standalone Swarm client.

**[1:02:43] SPEAKER_01:** Starting 2018, you said?

**[1:02:45] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[1:02:46] SPEAKER_01:** So all the way through until that point, you were continuing to work as a sort of a geth team member?

**[1:03:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yes. Officially we were part of the geth team, as part of the Amsterdam entity. Slowly extending the team as the protocol got some movement. It was interesting times because I remember in 2016, after Nick Johnson left, we hired some other people on the protocol. And then that’s when I emerged as the team leader, organically trying to put together the threads.

**[1:03:52] SPEAKER_01:** And so with the Swarm Foundation, how and when did that happen? How did you come to leave the geth team?

**[1:04:12] SPEAKER_00:** It was 2018 autumn—actually 2018 summer—when a person called Albert came and started to offer help for Swarm. They were asking what we need. They seemed very helpful.

**[1:04:36] SPEAKER_01:** Albert Ni is this?

**[1:04:40] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, I think so.

**[1:04:41] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, who had basically joined the Ethereum Foundation at the same time as Aya.

**[1:04:47] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, Aya was very helpful. To be honest, I’m on very good terms with Ming and Vitalik as well, but when Aya came, she seemed very helpful and tried to solve some staffing problems and things. But the negotiations started, and I’m here. And after that it seems that by Prague we got into some serious discussions. And then after that, I think it was right at the last day of Devcon Prague, we submitted the proposal for funding, immediate funding. And it was very interesting because I never really got any serious feedback on that. I always wondered what’s going to happen. And then there were some issues that went on with Sean O’Connor. This is a point of contact delegated by Aya.

**[1:05:56] SPEAKER_01:** Right.

**[1:05:57] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, he was the delegated point of contact for us, the Swarm team. And then slowly, after that, I think the EF “scope” changed a bit, and that’s when every team needed to submit a proposal and all kinds of things. This whole scheme started of trying to graduate some of the other teams and some of the protocols after the Foundation. We have to have them get individual funding and then reach the gap with some grants. And that’s what happened with Swarm as well. So I remember 2019 there was a Swarm Summit in Madrid, which was very successful. We had a lot of partnerships. We subscribed to some monetary help as well. And then the Foundation also promised to back it up. And somehow that never happened, so we resorted to launching our own token, which we did in 2021. And it’s already been one year into the new Swarm client, like the “bee” client.

**[1:08:10] SPEAKER_01:** When you launched the token, was that the same sort of time as your codebase became independent? Did that coincide that you’re like, right, we’re an independent thing, we’re going to make a new client, we’re going to switch to libp2p, and it’s not going to be integrated directly with geth? Were those happening at the same time, or did the tech happen earlier?

**[1:08:28] SPEAKER_00:** Not really. I think the Swarm codebase was taken out of geth quite a bit before. I’m not even sure where, but I think it was PoC 4. And when it was taken out, it was too experimental, I guess, or something. Anyway, it’s not a very good idea to mix the two. And then we were able to conduct a very separate development scheme and agenda.

**[1:09:17] SPEAKER_01:** And I guess maybe Nick Johnson’s experience with spinning out ENS and the ENS Foundation, that would have preceded yours. So perhaps you were looking to that as a pattern. Sorry, we’re getting some really bad audio. Can you maybe move a little closer?

**[1:09:41] SPEAKER_00:** Can you hear me now?

**[1:09:43] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that’s better.

**[1:09:45] SPEAKER_00:** ENS is very inspiring. And then we did get some grants from the Foundation, and also a bridging grant. And then, as I said, somehow it never materialized with that kind of program, that budget that we put together with the team. But ultimately we made it. And then we had our own foundation in Switzerland, which started as an association, a small association, which issued tokens, which is the Swarm token, and yeah, another new year of funding.

**[1:10:29] SPEAKER_01:** One thing we skipped over, maybe we can just quickly go back to, is Devcon One. So that was in London in November 2015. I assume you were there. What are your memories of that event? I just recently re-watched it and I remember I was doing pretty much—

**[1:10:52] SPEAKER_00:** I was kind of very sick already. I don’t know if you know, but I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2009, 15 years ago. And when I did Devcon One, it was not very easy to follow. I was a bit surprised. I didn’t remember at the time that I was so sick, such difficulty in terms of my movement. So I’m sorry for the maybe unsolicited diversion. But yes, as for the content, I remember that we had a very successful presentation of Swarm. There was a lot of interest at the time. I was in Shanghai at the second.

**[1:11:49] SPEAKER_01:** Looking back at some Devcon One videos recently, my takeaway is so many ideas were presented by that point. Nearly anything you can think of in all the different areas, it seemed somebody was working on that. You had this real flourishing of people building on Ethereum by that point. Anything you could imagine seemingly was presented there.

**[1:12:24] SPEAKER_00:** I remember when I came in, because we always thought that from next year, we’re going to have always wonderful decentralized services like decentralized delivery, or Just Eat, or whatever you call it, like decentralized eBay, decentralized Uber and Airbnb, and all kinds of things. And of course, they all need their Swarm-like thing, or distributed and scalable data behind it. That came much, much later.

**[1:13:03] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Many of them like five or 10 years too early.

**[1:13:07] UNKNOWN:** Yes.

**[1:13:09] SPEAKER_00:** And yeah, so this is definitely what happened to Swarm. Like it did not realize much later, it has.

**[1:13:19] SPEAKER_01:** But now at least it’s working. So yeah, can you talk a little bit about where Swarm is now? What’s happening and how’s the functionality?

**[1:13:43] SPEAKER_00:** So we have a very solid network, and we can consolidate—we’ve had the narrow definition of the protocol. So basically it’s like the distributed chunk store definition, where nodes communicate and then distribute the chunks. It’s a storage model as well as a distribution network. And it has rather strong privacy properties, which are quite unique. And we use older analogies like the checkbook and postage stamp. Postage stamp is something that you attach to a chunk, with some data, to keep it alive. And it’s kind of a hot wallet in a way. When you put some money on it, some storage rent gets deducted, and when it runs out of funds, your content is live and it is available hot. And very early on we implemented this manifest idea. The manifest is basically a mapping of strings to documents, which you can use as a kind of key-value store, but sitemap, but also a directory tree, right? So you can implement directories and files. And that was the first extension. Let’s go higher level here. And we were already talking about erasure codes back in 2016. We only implemented maybe two or three years ago. It’s a very interesting concept of how we implement erasure codes. But yeah. There’s also this thing called ACT, which is like the access control mechanism that allows you to manage the grantees that can access the file or directory. So we have a way to get to the encryption key, the encrypted content. And one of the very interesting features in Swarm is how you handle mutability. It’s kind of similar chunks of feeds, Swarm feeds. It’s basically kind of ENS: the integrity of the chunk is not by the content, but by some semantic convention. Like, okay, it’s my website, it’s my CV; this is something you can guess. The mutable content is actually attested by signature. So that’s the signature which is the integrity of the chunk. And that’s how we handle mutable content. And it’s great for quickly changing stuff like databases and things.

**[1:17:19] SPEAKER_01:** Where would you say Swarm, as of 2026, sits and compares with IPFS plus Filecoin, or Arweave, or others? How do they differ, and what kind of usage?

**[1:17:40] SPEAKER_00:** You’re asking me. You probably got the technical answer of how it compares.

**[1:17:44] SPEAKER_01:** Well, let’s keep it light.

**[1:17:48] SPEAKER_00:** If I am a dumb end user—no, I know, but what I’m saying is that it’s difficult. Not to mention in terms of adoption or in terms of even—yeah. So IPFS is obviously very widely used also in the Ethereum realm. It was always a very good and relatively simple architecture, easy to understand. If you compare it to Swarm, it definitely lacks privacy features as well as incentives, really. You can say that you can build stuff and therefore get it preserved, but those pinning services are actually quite centralized. So it’s attackable in a way.

**[1:18:52] SPEAKER_01:** Does Filecoin work? Is that a real thing now?

**[1:18:56] SPEAKER_00:** Filecoin kind of does it in some way. It’s mainly good for archival, and you have very strong availability proofs, which actually work for proving that whatever you store there is available in various replicas, which is not an obvious thing to do at all. But I don’t want to mock it, but there is an internet meme of someone taking a magnetic tape out into an envelope, and it says like someone retrieving stuff from Filecoin. So obviously if you don’t have any retrieval protocol or hot retrieval layer with incentivization, with some sort of SLA layer attached to it, then it’s a bit difficult to evaluate the proposition there. Since then there were a lot of trials, and since then it’s changed, and there were attempts to link it to IPFS, which is itself a distribution platform. And it doesn’t show. And I think it’s a bit of an overkill in terms of the incentives, the availability proofs. And it also suffers some of the previous issues. You have to negotiate the market of storage. In Swarm, Swarm is very different. The positive incentives: you get rewards for storing the chunks that belong to your neighborhood. The pricing and the redistribution of the postage stamp revenue: there’s no extra “deal” that you file somewhere. Chunks are always distributed across many neighborhoods, and whatever belongs to you, the node operators get rewarded for. And distribution can have a nice property of a central pricing, that can be sensitive to supply signals that we can bring itself. So it has this nice method of checking supply and therefore set the price based on that. That type of model. The question is whether it works at all, and some of the assumptions might not hold. But in terms of its bandwidth incentive, and in terms of the distributed storage incentives, and also the privacy properties, I would say it’s quite an advanced framework. Apart from all the obvious goodies that we talked about, like addressing and URL-based addressing and what we call the storage and balance distribution chunks. And also the monetary incentives is what drives the thing from bottom up. There are voices in the community that don’t take very seriously this kind of monetary incentives, and they think maybe altruism is not that bad. I understand where they’re coming from. However, we take it seriously that the monetary incentive, having someone behind a node client, is modeled by a rational profit-maximizing agent. And then it’s a matter of maximizing your profit into something that’s generally usable on the network level. That emerges as an intelligent system that can serve other purposes. And this is what incentive design—this is what Ethereum is amazing at: it can express with smart contracts what is self-enforcing. Smart contracts can express a beautiful incentive system. And for example in Swarm, it takes very seriously that all kinds of strategic decisions that clients can make, that don’t lead to immediate disconnect because of a syntax problem or primitive violation, should be incentivized. Doing anything else than what the protocol dictates should not get a better reward. Basically, at least you lose money. All the way from connectivity, how you connect and how you forward stuff, and all the strategy of what you can serve, what you archive, what you cache. All this kind of stuff is properly incentivized.

**[1:25:03] SPEAKER_01:** Let me ask you one last big question. Looking back over these 10 years, have things happened as you thought they might? What you thought Ethereum was at the start, has that been what it’s become? Looking back on these 10 years, what are your big reflections on this journey?

**[1:25:23] SPEAKER_00:** Interesting question. It seems it’s still very close to my heart in a way. But apart from being sentimental, I also have something that it definitely fulfills many of its early promises, and maybe some of them are maturing a bit slower than I would have wanted. Just to think of Proof of Stake, which was supposed to come after maybe a few years, and then it happened. But some things take a while to even develop, to even conceptualize properly. And yes, of course some of these earlier ambitions of proper apps being—of Swarm, sorry, like Swarm/Ethereum apps—didn’t materialize, or I would say they’re not properly materialized. Because I think your Web3 app is as Web3 as the weakest link of it. So if you have anything that’s not so decentralized in the stack, like—think of the easiest examples of Tornado Cash, but using infrastructure.

**[1:26:54] SPEAKER_01:** Right, right.

**[1:26:55] SPEAKER_00:** I forgot to say that, but you know, and if Reddit blocks Tornado Cash and it was obviously illegal to use in the US, then— I mean, we still suffer from some of these early neglects: neglecting clients, neglecting proofs and verification. It’s a bit surprising to me, and it’s worth facing that. We talk about Web3, but it’s actually just—we talk through RPC, which is centralized, and then we talk NFTs and all this kind of stuff. I mean, as Moxie Marlinspike’s blog put it, he showed when the NFT that he created turns into a third image. So, you know, it’s kind of—he of course, it’s fun, it’s okay to poke fun. We’re all part of this. And of course some of these things might be a promise of maybe a Swarm or something that we might have missed, and therefore lagging behind with some of these overall ecosystem promises. But instead of lamenting on this, I keep on trying to share some positive energy into constructive action. So in this way, I’m relatively optimistic about the future. And I think this unstoppability is kind of unstoppable now. It’s really not possible to slow it down. And I really hope that when people get it, they don’t necessarily follow stupid regulations curbing the uses of it, and instead just—yeah.

**[1:26:55] SPEAKER_01:** Okay, well thanks so much, and all the very best.

**[1:26:55] SPEAKER_00:** Thank you very much. It was lovely to talk to you and reminisce about the past.

**[1:26:55] SPEAKER_01:** You too. Okay, thanks so much. Bye-bye.
