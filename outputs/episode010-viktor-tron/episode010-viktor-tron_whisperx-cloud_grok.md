**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** So hello, I am Bob Summerwill and this is Early Days of Ethereum with my good friend Viktor Trón. So hi Viktor, how are you?

**[00:10] SPEAKER_01:** Very very well thank you. Hello Bob, thank you for inviting me to the show. It's wonderful. Three minutes.

**[00:20] SPEAKER_00:** Well great to have you here. So yeah, we bumped into each other in Buenos Aires for Devconnect and I'd hope to record there but for one reason or another that never happened. So good to connect online instead. So talking about early days of Ethereum, you were very early in Ethereum. So I mean, what were you doing in your life prior to that that led you to the project and then work-wise I was a.

**[00:50] SPEAKER_01:** Not exactly. I wouldn't say I was exactly very close to the crypto scene, to be honest. I was working on a project with BBC News Labs, basically a news juice project. It was trying to ingest a lot of news sources, like from old photo archives, video archives, and everything, and juice it, basically work through the speech recognition and everything, and categorize it, and made it searchable in a very nice way. I mean, of course, it's one of those BBC sponsored projects no one really needed and it was never really used but it was a nice project to work on. Anyway, I left the job at that time. You were in London, you were living in London. Yeah, I was in London, I was living in London and I left the job because I found Ethereum. I was very excited right away. So when, I guess it was when Gavin visited this kind of web, new web meetup, I'm sorry, I think it was a new web meetup, and then presented Ethereum, I was absolutely taken aback, and I thought it was amazing and a game changer. And I mean, what led me to it, to be honest, I was already quite a bit into Bitcoin, which is kind of interesting, because Bitcoin came into my life through a friend who I knew from an anarchist club or like a Facebook group basically. So he introduced me to it on ideological grounds but of course I was very interested in the tech as well. But it took me quite a while to understand what is blockchain, how all these things come together. But by that time I was solid in understanding the blockchain, and my understanding was solid enough so that I could question Gavin and then Vitalik and say that is absolutely not going to work, obviously, because of this whole thing problem. And bit by bit, when I understood that they all had answers to every question that I could ever think of, then that's when I got convinced that they're probably the geniuses I really can look up to and have in my biography to learn from. It was a very great start. And so when Gavin presented Ethereum, the next day I was already hacking on the C++ codebase actually, and had my first PR in. We met in a cafe in Dalston, I think. And I remember it was quite impressive that he was using Mac, but actually was running Linux OS on it. It was very impressive already.

**[03:30] SPEAKER_00:** And so you mentioned your anarchist group there. So had Bitcoin earlier been interesting to you from that kind of monetary.

**[03:40] SPEAKER_01:** Anarchist libertarian, I have to say yes, I have to say yes. I mean, when Bitcoin came, this was the time when I learned what money was really. I mean, before I didn't even grasp this notion and it was very important times in my life and it was really a game changer to have a framework in which I could totally identify myself with. And yeah, libertarian I don't know if it's the right word but I really like this kind of Austrian view of economy. And I understood how our money was used and what inflation was, which I never really understood before. It was okay. I came late to the game, let's say. But yeah. And then it was all very.

**[04:30] SPEAKER_00:** Was history after that. And the next web meeting that you mentioned, was that like a recurring meetup that you were going to or were you regularly going to web meetups?

**[04:40] SPEAKER_01:** Yes but yes but this one particularly I saw that because I saw Vitalik's presentation in Miami and so that really got me interested. So I knew what I was in for, and I went and showed up for that meeting in Hoxton Square, I think it was, that meeting. Sorry, you said Vitalik's presentation, was that the one that he'd given in Miami? Yes, exactly, Miami conference. And there was a so I kind of knew already what I expect from it, but of course I never really understood and Gavin helped me quite a bit to understand it. So it was really great. Were you watching a variety of Bitcoin conference talks? Was that a sort of a regular thing that you were doing at that point, watching YouTube? Yes, at the time I was very interested and very much into these things. I mean, I was hoping that changes related to this kind of technologies would come a lot earlier. I was already careful.

**[05:50] SPEAKER_00:** I was sold on the hype a bit, or contributed to it myself in a way. Had you been following along with things like Mastercoin and Colored Coins and other Bitcoin 2.0 projects?

**[06:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, actually I did, yeah. It was kind of a, I think it was BitShares at the point. I'm sorry? And it was BitShares, I think. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And there was this kind of, and then Open Transactions, which was very close to Gavin's heart, I think. We worked together. And yeah, I don't know what came out of that after all, but it's interesting. And then, so after I left the BBC and spent that winter in Thailand, half in the retreat and then in my spare time I was working on the yellow paper and making my way through the really hard notation and getting it on paper. Yes, a lot of people struggled with that sort of math heavy notation.

**[06:50] SPEAKER_00:** And so you went to Gav's presentation, which would have been very early February. So, I mean, that was only like a week or so after Vitalik's presentation in Miami. It would have been very, very close. So you spoke to Gav there and then you exchanged emails, did you?

**[07:10] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, basically, we exchanged emails. He put me on Skype group. There was a Skype group at the time. I think it was 20-odd people on it, really. So not a big crowd. And yeah, that's how it all started. So it was very nice in the beginning to have this kind of really grandiose ideas and chat and be part of it. I'm super proud and very happy that I managed to be at the.

**[07:40] SPEAKER_00:** It's kind of a lucky move, to be honest. So was it a fair bit later in that year that you started working with Danny on Swarm?

**[07:50] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, then it came a little bit later. So yes, first of all, in the spring, I started working on the yellow paper and then a bit on the C++, but not a lot. And then I think it was in March or sometime that I showed up on the first Ethereum meetup. Maybe not the first. I think you told me that it was not the first, but the second one. In London, this is? Yes, yes, yes, yes. So this was organized by Stéphane Tual. Stéphane Tual there. There was a Mihail there, who later came, Nakasha, I think. And then sorry, Mihail was there, right? Yes, yes. And I think who I talked to quite a lot was Jack du Rose. Yeah, of Colony fame, exactly. And then there is when I met Jeff first. Jeff became my boss later. He came to London for that meet-up? Yes, yes, he did. And so I kind of saw that it's quite an international crowd and from all over the world kind of doing these things. So I kind of took it very seriously. I had left my job and then joined the ranks and I kind of started contributing to the Go code and so yeah after that I was really into Go lang. That's where I contributed most and became part of the Go Ethereum team after Jeff offered this job around September October that year when the foundation was already.

**[09:30] SPEAKER_00:** Of actually paying out some salaries or like recruiting people on the teams. Yeah. So, I mean, I was looking at the timing on that. So the Ethereum Foundation was founded in July of 2014. And then the crowdsale was going through July, August, September. And then, yeah, the hiring, that first wave of we've actually got some money to hire people was sort of September, October.

**[10:00] SPEAKER_01:** So October, in October, I can't remember, I was negotiating with Aeron Buchanan, I remember. Right, right. My contact then. And then, I don't know when the Amsterdam office was actually funded, but I already visited Jeff later in that year there. So when I first kind of joined, I was talking to my friends in Hungary, and some of them related to this Facebook group, and among them like Dani, Fefe, and there was another person who was very close to Swarm later, but never actually entered the scene officially. Let him be unnamed. And so there was some thinking that maybe the four of us can form a group and we can just join as a kind of sub-dev team or something. It never happened. So we were just hired individually.

**[11:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yes. Later that year, there was Devcon Zero. Is that correct? Yeah. I mean, if we just pop back a little bit. So through 2014, prior to the sale and so on, I mean, so how were things working early in 2014? I mean, you've mentioned a Skype group where were most people kind of working through Skype?

**[11:20] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes, yes. It was really mainly everything was done by basically Gavin, Jeff and the rest of us were just Sherpas in the way at the time and then just tapping out. I mean, I'm talking about the technical stuff. I'm really not sure about the admin and the foundation stuff. So I hope no offense is taken from anyone. But yeah, for tech stuff, it's yeah. So I think it was actually in July that Jeff shared a kind of PoC theme to do with me and kind of introduced me to the intricacies of the then aspiring devp2p peer-to-peer protocol. And so I think that was my first project that was really in the code base that I wrote it, which was then later scrapped and completely rewritten by Felix and the other guys. But that was my first attempt at kind of Go Ethereum networking layer. At the time, I was trying to say really crazy ideas to Jeff about some developer tooling, like contract verification and staging and fake blockchain environment and stuff. And there were other things to do and it was focusing on the end user applications like what was it at the time? I think it was the eth Go. I think it was under eth Go, but it was actually later the Mist browser business. It was a browser. And so he was kind of trying to talk me out of it and said that the other group, the C++ team is assigned to that anyway, so let me not tread on unwanted paths. And so he kind of brought me back to yeah. Well, I mean, you had Aleth, you had Alex Beregszaszi I guess with an earlier kind of in connection of that yeah that's good and then but there was some kind of not so glorious tasks as well at the time like refactor logging and things like this I remember in the early days but there was also a time when I was learning Go lang, because that was also not the super popular language. There was a lot of learning to do.

**[13:50] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, it was relatively new at that point. So you'd mentioned the yellow paper. So in those very early months of 2014, Gav in particular seemed to be incredibly productive in terms of what he was getting through with the C++ client and that yellow paper. I mean, was it usually the code that was leading and then the yellow paper was being kind of modeled after that? It's hard for me to say if they really were that kind of hand-in-hand developing, I think.

**[14:20] SPEAKER_01:** I can't really tell. Maybe it's better to ask him, to be honest. But yes, the productivity and actually the speed that he was churning out code was absolutely stunning. It was a few months after some of his clients already worked. Yeah, to be honest, I mean, Jeff was the same and Jeff was also incredible in his productivity. And those people were really nice examples in front of me. So I was really happy to learn from them. And I mean, I think that triangulation was so important, right, of having multiple clients and the spec.

**[15:10] SPEAKER_00:** And you had the Pyeth client, though not really to that production status, but those three groups all, you know. There was a glorious.

**[15:20] SPEAKER_01:** Statement that Ethereum was very proud of, like this multi-client development was leading to very solid specs. It was actually true, but of course that was not the reason, but the reason was that all these brilliant individuals just followed their own favorite language and just wanted their own clients to be built. But ultimately what came out of it is amazing, like the specification was really solid. I just remember just a few times that the specification had to be changed. There's like one case when there's a modular operation that was not good for negative numbers exactly, not sure exactly. There was another one when I think it was around Easter 2015, or before, in the year leading to the launch. And I think that was when there was a problem that two blocks had the same timestamp, I think. And that led to a fork. I remember I wrote a kind of blog post about it.

**[16:30] SPEAKER_00:** Never published it, so it's interesting. Talking to Jakub Czepluch, so he was an intern at the Berlin office in 2015, but he was telling me about a hard fork that had happened on the mainnet around two weeks or so after launch, which I was completely unaware of. But then looking back, there was a security announcement by Yoichi. It was a patching of the Geth client. And while I've been doing stuff myself in terms of running old clients, I saw that as well. If you run Geth 1.0.0 or Geth 1.0.1, it gets stuck. It can't go through Frontier blocks. So it was actually a hard fork. Do you remember what it was related to? It was not that interesting that you remembered. I mean, it was some kind of gas counting or something. Just some kind of little bug. But that was funny. That was a thing that I was not aware about because, you know, it was a hard fork, but it was never given a name because it was just an accident. And you wonder how many more of these little things there were that happened that sort of forgotten in the midst of time. But yeah, so through that early 2014 year, you were working initially on the C++ and then later on the Go. I mean, how many people were working on Go in 2014? I mean, it was really just a few people around Jeff. I think it was mainly Bas and Alex van de Sande.

**[18:20] SPEAKER_01:** From Brazil, and yeah, and few. But you were the second team member then, is that right? Correct, just about. Maybe actually the first officially, I'm not sure. The first paid one, I'm not sure. But I mean, we came roughly at the same time with Alex and I think with Felix. Right. Yeah, in terms of employment. Yeah, but I meant when you were working earlier, you know, when you started there. I mean, were there other people working on that Go Ethereum ahead of your joining in with him? Not really, not really. So I was pretty much among the ones that contributed and the core that inspired him. And there was quite a vibrant community of people making the data become slow. It was like Nick Savers around, super tall dude. And we were going together to the Bitcoin conference. I think it was in April. Yeah. Oh, you went to Toronto. No, no, it was in Amsterdam. Okay. And that's when I really talked to Vitalik quite a bit. It was very nice. And there was a big party that month, so it was a nice time.

**[19:40] SPEAKER_00:** Nick Savers is a name that I've seen a lot of times. And I've never really met or spoken to him. I guess he was around a lot early and then maybe kind of disappeared out. And maybe he's a little bit of an anon guy that doesn't show his face. Yeah. I mean, he never joined. I don't think he was ever an official part of any team. But he was always there, around and helping us. I think he was employed by some bank. But I saw he and some others did the first continuous integration. You know, they were doing the build system. Nice, nice. And then he did work on the Java client as well. That is true. And the Java client was mainly.

**[20:30] SPEAKER_01:** By, what was his name? Roman Mandeleil. That's correct, Roman Mandeleil. Kind of mysteriously disappeared after a few years. I'm not sure what happened to him. I did see him on Facebook for quite a time. He seems to have either disappeared or something since. I remember I spoke to him at the London Devcon, the Devcon one. Definitely around there with the whole EthereumJ team yeah I don't know what their name was but Ether.camp that's correct okay thanks for reminding us well nostalgic so yeah it was early sort of early 2017 I think that he kind of disappeared. They did Hacker Gold.

**[21:20] SPEAKER_00:** And you know, this is some kind of like hackathon that there was some controversy about. It looked like the team kind of bought votes or something, but were paid out anyway. And then yeah, he sort of disappeared with some people thinking he'd exit scammed. I'm not convinced he did. Because if he did, it was the worst exit scam ever. Because it was so early. You know, like it wasn't like anyone had got any kind of big amount of money or anything at that point. It was sort of a very poor scam. He was definitely a man of principles.

**[22:00] SPEAKER_01:** Principles so maybe so you'd mentioned about your sort of collaborative sub-team so that's Ethersphere. Well, it was wishful thinking that might be Ethersphere but on the other hand I did register that as an organization on GitHub at least and even meant yes it I think it was pretty much the anyway, I mean, if I could call it a brand. I mean, I think at that time, it was only Aeron Buchanan who was right, yeah, Harris. Who later became Monax. This is Marmot, Marmot. And they did some nice work, by the way. But yes, Ethersphere was the home of most of our work. And then committing through that to the code base. So that was yourself, Daniel Nagy, Zsolt Felföldi. Yes, Zsolt Felföldi, yeah. Already hired to work on the light client it was in 2015 already and yeah because he was not on Devcon 0 but yeah Devcon 0 was already confirmed and it's very so for Danny and me joining by that time, there was quite a bit of buzz around with him, I think. So maybe, could you say a bit about Swarm? Because my understanding is that some of the ideas went an awful long way back. Yeah. So I don't know if you remember, there was in May 2014, there was a seminar, series of talks in Whitechapel somewhere, or somewhere in East London. And in that talk, that was the first appearance of web3 in the Ethereum context. It was usually explained, and the founders really realized how decentralization can basically also be extended then to support the entire backend of the entire web. And basically, if you extend it to the data, app data, and hosting, and to basically put the data layer on top, and then maybe the messaging, then you can conceive of it as the world computer with this holy trinity of you can see them like the Ethereum blockchain as the world computer's CPU and the working memory and disk would be Swarm and then Whisper would be the messaging layer. So you were mentioning Whitechapel so that was again some meetups, was it? Yes, yes. And I think maybe Theo even had some sort of co-working or some sort of high-end office there, maybe a room or two, because I very often found Vitalik there. So I'm not entirely sure how this works out. I don't want to say anything. Would that have been there were a lot of internal meetings as well.

**[25:30] SPEAKER_00:** Would that have been when that kind of famous diagram would first have surfaced? You know, the one with the circle and the apps coming in at the side? Yes, that was just about that time, yeah. Including QML, I saw. So it was not just HTML, it was QML and Qt as other anticipated tech platforms.

**[25:50] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, so that's when Web3 was born, and it's kind of the crazy protocol names like after the ETH, which is also this letter in Icelandic.

**[26:00] SPEAKER_00:** Oh yeah, the thorn. Yes exactly and so that's when this and then was invented also the mnemonics gimmicks the those Ethereum well the sub protocols right protocols running on a common basis but the Ethereum was just one of one of many related protocols.

**[26:20] SPEAKER_01:** And that's why I was very dedicated to this whole Ethereum at the time. I really understood what it means to have the entire Turing-complete computation being secured on its own with the blockchain. And I really envisioned quite a change in how the internet works if you have Swarm and Whisper and all these things. So I quite liked the idea. And then later I learned that not only did they work on BitTorrent at the time, but actually some of us, like Dani, operating a DC++ node, had some legal troubles. Maybe we can also talk about this with him at some point. So that's kind of brought the Go team quite directly in the realm of implementing Swarm this idea of a decentralized storage and incentivization etc and an incentive solution connected. And Zsolt mentioned to me that he thought that the idea for Swarm had gone back to at least 2011? Yeah, so there was this idea. I mean, of course, I don't know about that, but it was mainly Dani's idea that he saw the amazing works of Petar, they also saw some drawbacks. So maybe historically it's best to derive the whole idea of Swarm from them. Because BitTorrent had difficulty starting a download, with all this throttling, and of course didn't have the proper incentives to keep the data. And also had the problem with the individual bits of the file not being addressable right away. You had to use a tracker to resolve them. And of course that's also a problem with how much privacy there is in the balance. Because, as you remember, for example in Germany there was legal prosecution for who used BitTorrent. Oh I didn't know that. And I mean not at that time but much later but yeah. So I think what Dani was trying to do is give an idea of how to chunk things in a way every chunk is content addressable. And also that the placement of chunks is also part of the DHT. So normally a DHT, like a distributed hash table. It's basically the idea that you put node IDs and then chunks or keys of content basically in the same space, and somehow you get information with location, like who to download it from, about these chunks from the neighborhoods that have the same address or similar address. So there's usually a metric on this, if you use the logarithmic distance like that then you can work with Kademlia and it's Kademlia networks you iterate through the peers, you keep a few peers connected and you query them, so do you know a closer one to this key, to this key, and when this key is like the hash of Star Wars, and you want to watch Star Wars, and then you query them, and ultimately you see where the chunks are we can download from. So obviously this is not very private. And also, as you know from this kind of legal problems, it's also not really deniable. So if you enforce certain chunks should reside, you enforce a layer on top of it, then you can possibly deny that you know anything about it. It's just the system that enforces parts of the Star Wars story. Basically, it was Dani's genius idea that I think we call it the DPA, Decentralized Preimage Archive. It's basically an archive of pre-images. Pre-image is a piece of data that the image of which is the hash, the pre-image is what's before the hashing, the actual piece of the data. And so this idea of actually storing not the location, but the actual data at the place in the DHT, has direct DHT interpretation, was the DPA. And that was a very important notion that came and then became very important in Swarm. And then a lot of other things came. So I remember when we were in 2015 or 2014, I'm not sure. And in the winter, we were sitting in the Arena Plaza in Budapest, the three of us with Fefe, talking about this and how to start implementing it. Because there was pressure to implement the whole thing using UDP as the networking stack, because it was considered that TCP is too heavy and too slow, but then obviously at the time we already had the devp2p protocol, it's very easy to implement it and then try this protocol. So I suggested that instead of using UDP, just use TCP, but use it for forwarding, keep alive some connections, these permanent connections with the peers, and just use Kademlia through the live connections that each forwarding peer locally decides to forward to the closer node, and ultimately backward, like if you forward the request and you backward the chunk. And so it seemed very easy to implement, and we did exactly that. It turned out to be one of the best and most interesting choices of Swarm. It turns out that that's what allows peer-to-peer accounting to be working, and also gives the privacy features that Swarm has. This is, in this case, the originator of the request, if you think about it. No one knows that when someone is asking you something, that they want to watch Star Wars or someone upstream wants to watch Star Wars. It directly solved the opportunistic caching problem, how to distribute automatically popular content, retrieval paths, all the forwarding peers can just remember some chunks. It's very interesting how these ideas started. And then basically we coalesced in 2016. So I think the first release of Swarm which in Geth 1.5. It was in, I'm not sure, one second. It was December 2016, yes. And this Alpha public pilot was released. And I remember there was already how we viewed video. We call it streaming, but it's actually not real time streaming. It's just a watched video file. There were nice tweets about that too.

**[33:00] SPEAKER_00:** And just to take a step back, so I mean my understanding of a primary thought that there was with Swarm was that because you could have this the holy trinity right of decentralized compute, the blockchain for the decentralized file system and storage and then Whisper for that decentralized messaging, that you could have this really nice kind of synergy of a primary issue which is still really not solved of saying well how do you host the web front end right to make a whole application. Yes you need your smart contracts and your transactions and things but you need an application wrapping around that. So really the thought that if you had a decentralized storage mechanism that could store the HTML and the JavaScript and so on, that you want an incentive system so that that stuff is available if people want it, that you don't have a tragedy of the commons where only most popular content is available. But also because if you are building on Ethereum, you've got the cryptocurrency to do the incentives. You've got the smart contract system that allows you to implement those incentive systems. And all of these things can fit together into a holistic, unstoppable whole of saying oh here you go. You've got your applications which cannot be stopped. But that's the full stack.

**[34:40] SPEAKER_01:** And it seems even now that there's an awful lot of stuff which is dependent on centralized hosted services. And it's very sensible. Yeah, I am pretty sad about this, to be honest. I mean, there's a lot of these things. I don't know if you remember this big, I don't know, was it Bitbase? That lost the biggest crypto heist ever because of the Safe, you know, whatever. But if that had been using Swarm, then it would be much more difficult to change all these kind of transactions under the hood, because what they had to do is they hacked the person's, the dev's account, and then uploaded something through S3, which then made the Safe wallet used. And of course these are much more difficult to do if these things are content addressed of course registered. So this is how these things work. Like, you start from the blockchain, which is seen as the source of truth, ENS or services as a name. You resolve it to content hash, and then the content hash is retrieved from Swarm, from these decentralized stores. And I mean, again, that 2016 kind of era was when ENS was coming to life as well. So yeah, I mean, that's another important part. Actually, Nick Johnson was first part of the Swarm team. As part of the Swarm team, he developed the ENS, and then later took off and pivoted to ENS. I didn't know he worked on Swarm. I knew he was part of the Geth team, but he did some Swarm as well, eh? Well, definitely. I recruited him, to be honest. Fantastic. Did you know him in London? No, no, no. I mean, he was just part of the community. He was a very valuable contribution to the community.

**[36:50] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, to Swarm. Yeah, let me just check the timeline. But I think he got hired really pretty soon after me. I started in February 2016, and I think he was maybe June. Same kind of time as Hudson. Yeah. Let's see. So yeah, I started in February. Greg Colvin in March. Everton Fraga in April. And yeah, June, both Hudson and Jamie Pitts and Nick Johnson. All June 2016. What was I going to mention? So yeah, you talked about Devcon Zero. So that was November 2014 in Berlin. I imagine, was that the first time that you would have met quite a number of these people?

**[37:40] SPEAKER_01:** Absolutely. Especially memorable is my meeting with Alex Leverington. Oh, yes. Yeah. Very interesting. We had lots of discussions. Yeah. He was very adamant and very stubborn with his own way of thinking about the protocol. I have to say, he was much more knowledgeable than I was at the time, so I was trying to learn a lot from him. But at the same time, I was always trying to be a bit more pragmatic and trying to simplify. And I remember I first basically wrote together the specs for that devp2p protocol and then you know that was not really followed just right. Yeah it was a very interesting time.

**[38:40] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I mean, the other piece there is that libp2p, as part of the Protocol Labs IPFS, that already existed at that time. So that was kind of interesting, right? This whole devp2p, libp2p. I mean, you know how Ethereum kind of suffered from this not invented here syndrome.

**[39:00] SPEAKER_01:** Not invented here syndrome. Thank you, thank you. And you know, the RLP, RLPx stuff. Right. Then we have their own serialization protocol, like devp2p as well. But I have to say, devp2p at some point was kind of a lean protocol, excellent for the purposes of including it in Swarm for example. It's a lot less bloated but of course it had a lot of problems in terms of maintenance. It was just not appropriate to start from scratch in the way it's like in retrospect it was probably not the best idea to be honest but hey.

**[39:50] SPEAKER_00:** And I mean, that's got stuck in the execution clients forever. You know, the consensus clients now are using libp2p and aren't using RLP anymore. But the execution client got stuck with devp2p forever. And I mean, I remember having discussions with various people on this in 2016 of saying well you could have both protocols, people looking at could you do a bridge protocol so that some of the stuff could run over libp2p and you can have relay nodes, really with the thought that with libp2p you could run in a browser right, devp2p you could never run in a browser. And so was working with somebody from the Parity team, maybe Robert, around maybe a little later, 2017, 2018, of trying to see well can we get a light client in browser talking to all of these things? But it never quite happened. Some of these decisions just left forever. It was only after we left the foundation is when we kind of switched to libp2p as well because when we started the Bee client development. Right, right, I wasn't aware that that transition had happened. So I mean Devcon Zero, that was late 2014. But things continued through 2015 all the way to the July launch. At the time, Swarm was just an idea which was mainly.

**[41:50] SPEAKER_01:** Meant to be spec'd out or kind of started by Danny who had this very interesting past in p2p storage and he actually presented his vision of that that of course you know yeah everyone watching this is very good early capturing of this idea. And at that point he got hired in and that became a real thread of official development within the Ethereum stack around yeah but Danny and then slowly organically became a little bit of a sub team after that and yeah and so after that I never really contributed to the first POC which was even POC before Danny came. He was telling me that he was thinking that was what he would be doing when he was hired in but then almost immediately Jeff told him yeah no you're not, you're just working on Geth. Yes I mean we have Zsolt to develop the light client protocol he worked on for many many years and it's a bit sad that it never took off but.

**[43:20] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, well, I mean, it's tough. That's where my own journey started. Because when I got interested in Ethereum, the first thing I wanted to do was I was really into mobile and wearables at that time. So I wanted to see, can I run an Ethereum node on my smartwatch? So I was doing ARM Linux cross builds of CPP Ethereum. And my thought at that time was okay, light client is still getting worked out, but I'll get a full client working on all these devices. And then when light client comes out, they'll just work, right? So I can run a full client on a testnet, make sure it all works. But it's just a matter of time. Of course we'll have light clients. And of course everything will scale. And of course you can run all things on any devices, right? We're thinking every phone is going to have an Ethereum node running. Every router, media box. And it's still suffering the kind of RPC and then centralized access, right? How unstoppable is that? Yeah it will just come with every Linux distro, it will just be like a service that's just part of the Linux distro, just get shipped, you've just got this background service that is just talking Ethereum and it'd be the same as having a network stack or an audio stack or whatever. It's just like yeah you're going to have a consensus stack and.

**[45:10] SPEAKER_01:** You know, it'll just run in the background and just work. Cheap and easy. Yeah. No, that didn't quite happen. And then 10 years in, these things are starting, like I don't know if you know the Deboot project for example. No, what's that? How to boot from Swarm. Yeah, booting from Swarm. Yes. I mean, they're building the kind of UEFI client that can bring up any operating system. Wow, okay, that's interesting. Yes, interesting. I mean, it's not worked out fully yet, but the guys are really. I mean, there's a fair bit of networking stuff that would have to happen before you could even start. Right, like having some kind of bootstrapping little mini OS or something. Yeah. And it seems that even before that you can do it, just to yeah. I mean, they already have that kind of a small Linux environment is critical. And they moved from that. That's interesting. And they can do it just with the mm-hmm.

**[46:30] SPEAKER_00:** So I mean, through those early years prior to mainnet launch, you'd mentioned work on the yellow paper. So how was it being determined what feature complete, what good enough looks like? Had you got a good idea of what you'd have to have before launch could happen?

**[46:50] SPEAKER_01:** I mean well I didn't have a clear idea really because it took me a while to understand the full system to be honest with you. It's like I think it's only Jeff who really knew what was needed to be built and he was building massive things on his own single-handedly, it's really crazy. I mean not so good experience, but I was assigned the task of building the block pool, which was supposed to be the one that takes the blocks from the other clients, builds up the header chain, and validates it, etc. And I was working a lot on that, and every time he had enough and said okay I just build it and basically one or two days and it was done. And it was an interesting experience. And Christoph Jentzsch was building the cross-client tests as well. Did you do work with those tests yourselves? You, sorry, I mean? No, I didn't myself, but yeah, I remember he was always running and so I remember so in.

**[48:00] SPEAKER_00:** In July 2015 we had the arrival of Ming Chan and shortly afterwards pretty serious budget cuts because within that year or so the foundation had managed to pretty much burn through the vast majority of the money. Austerity I think was the official name of that. Yeah I remember.

**[48:20] SPEAKER_01:** And that time when Vitalik basically said that there is not going to be Swarm, what's going to be is maybe if you just use IPFS and let's start to work on the incentive system that we can put on that. Okay. And I remember, maybe it's not the secret anymore, but Jeff kind of let us keep working on Swarm from this period so we did and then there was enough to kind of there was a basically ready incentivization scheme for the bandwidth incentives. It's also very interesting because Swarm seems to be one of the only decentralized storage systems that has a proper bandwidth incentive proper accounting system like this did for that accounting and it seems like it's quite I don't know and it's probably conjecture but it doesn't look like there's any other proper way to do this because if you think about bandwidth first of all it's a kind of instant gratification thing. You forward for someone, like you serve a request or not. So it's not like the shady territory of a future promise like storage. You have to record your deal on the chain and some proof of availability etc. But here bandwidth is much more kind of yeah it seems like easier solved by just peer-to-peer accounting that I forward for you, you forward for me, and then we just settle for each other, and if there's a big tilt then some settlement should happen. But I'm not sure, maybe it doesn't even have to be some settlement around it. And then we kind of liked this idea, there's also this genius that came up in this checkbook idea. It's basically an early version of state channel like micropayment solution. And yeah, so that bandwidth incentive was a very powerful one. It lived on long. And then I remember that it seemed that the incentivization for storage was much more difficult to arrive at. There was the negative incentives, how to solve the problem of pricing and the growth and who's responsible for what, and if everything is recorded on chain, how to maintain the privacy of things. It was very difficult. So it came much later. I kind of worked out that part as well. It was only after the token, the BZZ token was released in 2021. Yeah well anyway so yeah going back to the roots yeah the austerity yeah it was. So you were continuing to work through late 2015 even though it had supposedly been defunded? Yeah kind of yes. I mean we were trying to figure out this incentive of course and in that sense we were off track in a way. And I was also working at the time on the Go Ethereum client on many aspects of it. And by 2017 the Swarm client was kind of integrated and that was released within Go Ethereum. It was in 2018 when the POC 3 release was part of Geth. So when the Swarm client was starting out we started a standalone Swarm client. Starting 2018 you said? Yeah. So all the way through until that point you were continuing to work as a sort of a Geth team member? Yes I mean officially we were part of the Geth Go Ethereum team. It's part of the Amsterdam entity. And yeah so slowly extending the team as the protocol got some movement so it was interesting times because I remember in 2016 when after Nick Johnson left he kind of hired some other people on the protocol and then yeah that's when.

**[53:00] SPEAKER_00:** I emerged as the team leader at the time, organically, trying to put together the threads. And so with the Swarm Foundation, how and when did that happen? And how did you come to kind of leave the Geth team I guess?

**[53:20] SPEAKER_01:** Well so it was 2018 autumn. Actually 2018 summer I and a person called Albert came and started to offer help for Swarm. They were asking what we need. They seemed very helpful. Albert Ni is this? Yes I think so. Yeah who had basically joined the Ethereum Foundation at the same time as Aya. Yeah Aya was very very I mean you know to be honest I'm on very good terms with Ming before as well but when Aya came she seemed very helpful and tried to solve some staffing problems and things. But the negotiations started and after that it seems that by Prague we kind of got into some serious discussions. And then after that we kind of I think it was right at the last day of the Prague Devcon we're submitting the proposal for funding, immediate funding. And then it was very interesting because I never really got any serious feedback on that. I was always a little bit wondering like what's going to happen. And then there were some issues that went on with Sean O'Connor. This is a point of contact delegated by Aya. Who sorry? Sean O'Connor. Right. Yes there was the delegated point of contact for us the Swarm team. And then slowly like after that I think the EF goals changed a bit and that's when every team needed to submit a kind of roadmap and proposal and all kinds of things. It's this whole scheme started of trying to graduate some of the teams and some of the protocols out of the foundation yeah we have to have them get individual funding and then bridge the gap with some grants and that's what happened with Swarm as well so after I remember 2019 there was a Swarm summit in Madrid. It was very successful. We had a lot of partnerships. We subscribed to some monetary help as well. And then the foundation promised to back it up. And somehow that never happened so we kind of resorted to launching our own token which we did in 2021. And it's already been one year into the new Swarm client like the Bee client. And yes so when we launched the token started a new with some new lease of life into the whole thing and that's when again we started working seriously on the positive storage incentives and the rest of the features just came. Yeah I mean was that the same sort of time as your code base became independent.

**[56:30] SPEAKER_00:** Did that kind of coincide that you're like right we're an independent thing, we're going to make a new client, we're going to switch to libp2p, and it's not going to be integrated directly with Geth? Were those happening at the same time or did the tech happen earlier?

**[56:50] SPEAKER_01:** Yes not really. I think the Swarm code base was taken out of Go Ethereum quite a bit before so I think I'm not even sure but I think it was POC 4. And when it was taken out I think it was yeah it was too experimental or something. Anyway it's not a very good idea to mix the two. And then also do this and then develop.

**[57:20] SPEAKER_00:** We were able to conduct a very separate development scheme and agenda. And I guess maybe Nick Johnson's sort of experience with spinning out ENS and the ENS Foundation that would have preceded yours. So perhaps you were looking to that as a pattern. Sorry we're getting some really bad audio. Can you maybe move a little closer? Can you hear me now? Yeah that's better.

**[57:50] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah ENS is very inspiring. And then we did get some grants from the foundation and also kind of bridging grant. And then as I said somehow it never materialized with that kind of program, that budget that we put together with the team. But ultimately we made it. And then we had our own foundation in Switzerland which started as an association, a small association which kind of issued tokens which is the BZZ token and yeah and that a new era of funding.

**[58:40] SPEAKER_00:** One thing we skipped over maybe we can just quickly go back to is Devcon one. So that was in London in November 2015. So I assume you were there. What are your memories of that event? I just recently re-watched it and I remember I was doing pretty much.

**[59:00] SPEAKER_01:** I don't know if you know but I was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2009, 15 years ago. When I did Devcon 1 it was not very easy to speak there. I was a bit surprised. I didn't remember at the time such difficulty in terms of my movement. And so I'm sorry for the maybe unsolicited diversion. But yes as for the content I remember that we had a very successful presentation of Swarm. There was a lot of interest at the time. I was in Shanghai at the second.

**[59:40] SPEAKER_00:** I mean I was looking back at you're saying you're looking back. I was looking back at some Devcon 1 videos recently. And like I guess my takeaway looking back is so many ideas were presented by that point. Nearly anything that you can think of in all the different areas, it seemed that somebody was working on that. You'd got this real flourishing of people building on Ethereum by that point. Like anything you could imagine seems seemingly was presented there. I remember when I came in.

**[60:20] SPEAKER_01:** Because we always thought that from next year we're going to have always wonderful decentralized services like the decentralized delivery or Just Eat or whatever you call it, like decentralized eBay, decentralized Uber and Airbnb and all kinds of things. And of course they all need their kind of Swarm-like thing and sort of scalable data layer behind it that came much later. Yeah many of them like five or ten years too early. Yes. And yeah so this is definitely what happened to Swarm, we did not realize much later. It is.

**[61:10] SPEAKER_00:** But now at least it's working so yeah but can you talk a little bit about where Swarm is now, what's happening and how's the functionality and yeah so we have a very solid network and we can consolidate the.

**[61:30] SPEAKER_01:** We've had a narrow definition of the protocol so basically it's like the distributed chunk store definition where nodes communicate and then they distribute the chunks. It's kind of a storage model as well as a distribution network. And it has rather strong privacy properties which are quite unique and I mean we have all the analogies like the checkbook and postage stamp. Postage stamp is something that you attach to a chunk of data to keep it alive. And it's kind of a hot wallet in a way. When you put some money on it some storage rent gets deduced and it runs out of funds you know your content is live and it's available hot. And yeah so on the way very early on we implemented this manifest idea. The manifest is basically a mapping of strings to documents which you can use as a key-value store but sitemap but also a directory tree right. So you can that way implement directories and files. And so that was the first extension this high-level thing. And we were already talking about erasure codes back in 2016 and it got only implemented maybe two or three years ago. And it's a very interesting concept of how we can implement erasure codes. But yeah so there's also this thing called ACT which is the access control mechanism that allows you to manage the grantees that can access a file or directory and so we basically have a way to get to the encryption decryption key for encrypted content. And one of the very interesting features in Swarm is how you handle mutability. It's kind of single writer mutable feeds, Swarm feeds. And it's basically a sub-blockchain like. So basically the integrity of the chunk is not by the content but by some semantic convention. Let's say like okay it's my website. Let's see this is something that you can guess my CV is then hashed together with your address. The mutable content actually has attestation by signature. So that's the signature which is the integrity of the chunk. And that's how we handle mutable content. And it's great for quickly changing stuff like databases and things.

**[64:30] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, where would you say Swarm as of 2024 sits and compares with say IPFS plus Filecoin or Arweave or others? How do they differ?

**[64:40] SPEAKER_01:** You know what kind of usage? You're asking me, you've probably got a technical answer for how it compares. Well let's keep it light. If I am a dumb end user no I know but what I'm saying is that it's difficult not to mention that in terms of for example adoption or in terms of even fame. Yeah I mean maybe in terms of adoption and just like top line features perhaps that one has and another doesn't. So IPFS is obviously very widely used also in the Ethereum realm. It was always a very good and relatively simple architecture easy to understand. I think it if you compare it to Swarm it definitely lacks the privacy features as well as the incentives really. I mean you can say that you can build stuff and therefore get it preserved but those pinning services are actually quite centralized. So it's attackable in a way. Does Filecoin work? Is that a real thing now? Filecoin kind of does it in some way. It's mainly good for archival and you have very strong they kind of a killer feature is the availability proofs which actually work for proving that whatever you store there is available in various replicas which is not an obvious thing to do at all and it's very good but only at the end I don't want to mock it but this is kind of an internet meme of someone taking a magnetic tape out into the envelope which is like someone retrieving stuff from Filecoin. So obviously if you don't have any kind of retrieval protocol or hot retrieval layer with incentivization with some sort of SLA attached to it it's a bit difficult to evaluate the proposition there. I mean of course since then there were a lot of tries and since then it's changed and there's also been attempts to link it to IPFS which is itself a distribution platform. So in fact one kind of yeah it doesn't show. And I think it's a bit of an overkill in terms of these incentives in terms of the availability proofs. And it also suffers some of the privacy issues as well. You have to negotiate the marketplace of storage. In Swarm Swarm is very different in that sense. The positive incentives it's just you get rewards for storing the chunks that belong to your neighborhood. And the pricing and the redistribution of the postage stamp revenue as there's no extra place that you file or anything somewhere. Chunks are always distributed across many neighborhoods and whatever belongs to you the node operators get rewarded for. And this distribution can have a nice property of central pricing. Basically that can be sensitive to some sort of supply signals that we have this nice method of checking supply therefore demand and then set the price based on that type of model. I mean the question is whether it works though and some of the assumptions might not hold when push comes to shove but so in terms of its bandwidth incentive and in terms of the positive storage incentives and also the privacy properties I would say it's quite an advanced framework. I mean apart from all the obvious goodies that we talked about like addressing and URL-based addressing and what we call redundant storage and balanced distribution of chunks and then also they take it very seriously that the monetary incentives is what drives the thing from bottom up. So I think there's some voices in the community that don't take very seriously this kind of monetary incentives and they think that maybe altruism is really not that bad. And I understand where they're coming from. However we take it seriously that having someone behind a node client it's modeled by a rational profit-maximizing agent. And then it's relatively low-level urge of maximizing your profit into something that's generally very usable on the network level emerges as an intelligent system that can serve other purposes. And this is what the incentive design this is what Ethereum is amazing at. It can express with the smart contracts where it's self-enforcing contracts how they can express a beautiful incentive system. And for example it's for me to take it so seriously that the only kind of strategic decisions that clients can make that basically not that doesn't lead to immediate disconnect because of a syntax problem or something we have more primitive violation. These should be incentivized at least to the extent of doing anything else than what the protocol dictates should not get a better amount of rewards. At least you lose money. All the way from the connectivity how you connect how you forward stuff and all the strategies that you serve what you retrieve what you cache. And all this kind of stuff are properly incentivized.

**[71:00] SPEAKER_00:** So let me ask you one last big question. Looking back over these 10 years, have things happened as you thought they might? What you thought Ethereum was at the start, has that been what it's become? Looking back on these 10 years, what are your big reflections on this journey.

**[71:20] SPEAKER_01:** Interesting question. So well the theme is still very close to my heart in a way but apart from the heart being saying this is from a sentimental approach I also think that it definitely fulfills many of its early promises. And maybe some of them are maturing a bit slower than I would have wanted. I mean just think of the proof of stake which was supposed to come after maybe a few years. And then it kind of happened. But some things take a while to even develop to even conceptualize properly. And yes I mean of course some of these earlier ambitions of proper apps being like the Swarm Ethereum apps of course didn't materialize as much. Or I would say that they're not considered as properly materialized because I think a Web3 app is as Web3 as the weakest link of it yeah? So if you have anything that's not so decentralized in a stack like I mean just think of the easiest examples of Tornado Cash but using Infura. Right right. I forgot what it was but you know and Reddit did block Tornado Cash point and it was obviously illegal to use in the US and then. But I mean so we still suffer from some of these early neglects like neglecting clients neglecting the whole proofs like proofs and verification. It's a bit surprising some of this to me and it's worth facing that you know we're talking about Web3 but it's actually just we talk through a PC which is kind of centralized and then we talk NFTs and all this kind of stuff. But as Moxie Marlinspike's blog put it he actually showed an NFT that he created turns into a turd image and yes yes so you know it's kind of I mean of course it's fun it's okay to poke fun of course we can laugh and of course some of these things might be a promise of maybe a Swarm or something that we might have missed and therefore kind of lagging behind with some of these overall ecosystem promises. But I don't know. But instead of lamenting on this I just keep on trying to share some positive energies into this constructive action and stuff. So in this way I'm kind of in general my approach can be described as the cyberpunk image that I'm relatively optimistic about the future of it. And I think this unstoppability is kind of unstoppable now. It's really not possible to slow it down. And I really hope that when people get it they don't listen to what is kind of stupid regulations curbing the use of it and instead just go for it. Okay well thanks so much and all the very best. Okay thank you very much lovely to talk to you and reminisce about the past. You too okay thanks so much bye.
