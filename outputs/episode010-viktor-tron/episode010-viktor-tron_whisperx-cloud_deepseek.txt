SPEAKER_00: So hello I am Bob Summerwill and this is Early Days of Ethereum with my good friend Viktor Trón. Hi Viktor, how are you?

SPEAKER_01: Very very well thank you. Hello Bob, thank you for inviting me to the show. It's wonderful.

SPEAKER_00: Great to have you here. So yeah we bumped into each other in Buenos Aires for DevCon and I'd hoped to record there but for one reason or another that never happened. So good to connect online instead. Talking about early days of Ethereum, you were very early in Ethereum. What were you doing in your life prior to that that led you to the project?

SPEAKER_01: Not exactly. I wouldn't say I was exactly very close to the crypto scene to be honest. I was working on a project with BBC News Labs, basically a news juice project. Trying to ingest a lot of news sources like from old photo archives, video archives and everything, and categorize it and make it searchable in a very nice way. Of course it's one of these BBC sponsored projects no one really needed and it was never really used. But it was a nice project to work on. Anyway, I left the job at that time. You were in London, you were living in London?

SPEAKER_00: So yeah, I was in London, I was living in London. And I left the job because I found Ethereum. I was very excited right away. So I guess it was when Gavin visited this kind of web, new web meetup, I think it was a new web meetup, and presented Ethereum, I was absolutely taken aback. I thought it was amazing and a game changer. What led me to it, to be honest, was that I was already quite into Bitcoin, which is kind of interesting. Bitcoin came into my life through a friend who I knew from an anarchist club or Facebook group. He introduced me to it on ideological grounds but of course I was very interested in the tech as well. It took me quite a while to understand what is blockchain, how all these things come together. But by that time I was solid in understanding the blockchain and my main discipline was solid enough so that I could question Gavin and then Vitalik. That was absolutely not going to work obviously because of this whole halting problem. Bit by bit, when I understood that they all had answers to every question that I could ever think of, that's when I got convinced that they're probably the geniuses I really want to look up to and learn from. It was a very great start. So when Gavin presented Ethereum, the next day I was already hacking on the C++ codebase actually and had my first PR in. We met in a cafe in Dalston I think. I remember it was quite impressive that I was using Mac but actually running Linux OS on it. It was very impressive already.

SPEAKER_00: You mentioned your anarchist group there. Had Bitcoin earlier been interesting to you from that kind of monetary...

SPEAKER_01: Anarchist libertarian, I have to say yes. When Bitcoin came, this was the time when I even learned what money really was. Before I didn't even grasp this notion. It was very important times in my life and it was really a game changer to have a framework in which I could totally identify myself with. Libertarian, I don't know if it's the right word, but I really like this Austrian view of economy. I understood how our money was used and what inflation was, which I never really understood before. I came late to the game, let's say.

SPEAKER_00: The next web meeting that you mentioned, was that a recurring meetup that you were going to or was this particularly the one you saw Gavin at?

SPEAKER_01: Yes but this one particularly I saw because I saw Vitalik's presentation in Miami. So that really got me interested. I knew what I was in for and I went and showed up for that meeting in Hoxton Square I think. You said Vitalik's presentation, was that the one he'd given in Miami? Yes exactly, Miami conference. So I kind of knew already what to expect from it but of course I never really understood and Gavin helped me quite a bit to understand it. Were you watching a variety of Bitcoin conference talks? Was that a regular thing you were doing at that point, watching YouTube?

SPEAKER_00: Yes at the time I was very interested and very much into these things. I was hoping that changes related to these technologies would come a lot earlier. Had you been following along with things like MasterCoin and Colored Coins and other Bitcoin 2.0 projects?

SPEAKER_01: Yes actually I did. I think it was BitShares at the point. And then OpenTransactions which was very close to Gavin's heart I think. We worked together. I don't know what came out of that after all but it's interesting. After I left BBC and ran in that winter, just spent in Thailand half in the retreat and then in my spare time I was working on the yellow paper and my way through the really hard notation. A lot of people struggled with that sort of math heavy notation.

SPEAKER_00: So you went to Gavin's presentation which would have been very early February. That was only like a week or so after Vitalik's presentation in Miami, very very close. So you spoke to Gavin there and then you exchanged emails?

SPEAKER_01: Yes, basically we changed emails. He put me on Skype group. There was a Skype group at the time, I think it was 20 odd people on it really, not a big crowd. That's how it all started. It was very nice in the beginning to have these grandiose ideas and chat and be part of it. I'm super proud and very happy that I managed to be at the...

SPEAKER_00: It's kind of a lucky move to be honest. So was it a fair bit later in that year that you started working with Danny on Swarm?

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, then it came a little bit later. First of all in the spring I started working on the yellow paper and then a bit on the C++ but not a lot. Then I think it was in March sometime that I showed up on the first Ethereum meetup, maybe not the first. You told me it was not the first but the second one. In London? Yes. So this was organized by Stéphane Tuil. There was a Mihai there, who later came, Nakasha I think. I talked quite a lot to Jack du Rose, of Colony fame exactly. Then I met Jeff first, Jeff became my boss later. He came to London for that meetup? Yes he did. So I saw it's quite an international crowd from all over the world doing these things. I took it very seriously. I left my job and joined the ranks and started contributing to the Go code. After that I was really into GoLang, that's where I contributed most and became part of the Go Ethereum team after Jeff offered this job around September/October that year when the foundation was already paying out some salaries or recruiting people on the teams.

SPEAKER_00: Looking at the timing on that, the Ethereum Foundation was founded in July 2014. Then the crowd sale was going through July, August, September. The hiring, that first wave of...

SPEAKER_01: When we actually got some money to hire people was September/October. October, I remember negotiating with Aeron Buchanan. My contact then. I don't know when the Amsterdam office was funded but I already visited Jeff later in that year there. When I first joined, I was really talking to my friends in Hungary, some related to this Facebook group, among them Dali, Fefe, and another person who was very close to Swarm later but never actually entered the scene officially. So there was some thinking that maybe the four of us can form a group and join as a sub-team or something. It never happened, we were hired individually.

SPEAKER_00: Later that year there was Devcon Zero? Correct?

SPEAKER_01: Yes in November.

SPEAKER_00: Popping back a bit, through 2014 prior to the sale, how were things working early in 2014? You mentioned a Skype group where most people were working through Skype?

SPEAKER_01: Yes, everything was done mainly by Gavin, Jeff, and the rest of us were just Sherpas tapping out at the time. For tech stuff, in July Jeff shared a kind of boy theme with me and introduced me to the intricacies of the then aspiring devp2p protocol. That was my first project really in the codebase that I wrote, which was later scraped and completely rewritten by Felix and other guys. But that was my first attempt at the networking layer. At the time I was trying to say really crazy ideas to Jeff about developer tooling, contract verification, staging, fake blockchain environment. He was focusing on end user applications, ETH Go which later became the Mist browser business. He tried to talk me out of it, said the C++ team was assigned to that so don't tread on unwanted paths. He brought me back to...

SPEAKER_00: You had Alex Beregszaszi earlier in connection to that.

SPEAKER_01: Yes Alex Beregszaszi. Not so glorious tasks as well at the time, refactoring logging and things like this I remember in early days. Also learning GoLang which was not super popular, there was a lot of learning to do.

SPEAKER_00: It was relatively new at that point. You mentioned the yellow paper. In those very early months of 2014, Gavin in particular seemed incredibly productive with the C++ client and yellow paper. Was the code leading and the yellow paper modeled after that?

SPEAKER_01: Hard to say if they were hand in hand developing. Gavin's productivity and speed churning out code was absolutely stunning. Within months some of his clients already worked. Jeff was the same, incredible productivity. Those people were really nice examples to learn from. Having multiple clients and specs was important.

SPEAKER_00: You had the Parity client though not to production status yet. Those three groups...

SPEAKER_01: Ethereum was proud of multi-client development leading to solid specs. Actually true but the reason was all these brilliant individuals followed their favorite language and wanted their own clients built. Ultimately what came out is amazing. Specification was really solid, only a few times it needed changed. One case was modular operation on negative numbers. Another around Easter 2015 leading to launch, a problem that two anchors had same timestamp leading to a fork. I wrote a blog post about it.

SPEAKER_00: Talking to Jakub Czepluk, he was an intern at Berlin office in 2015 telling me about a hard fork on mainnet around two weeks after launch I was unaware of. Looking back, there was a security announcement by Geth patching the client. Running old clients, Geth 1.00 or 1.01 gets stuck at frontier blocks. It was actually a hard fork. Remember what it was related to?

SPEAKER_01: Not that interesting, some kind of gas counting bug. It was a hard fork never given a name because it was just an accident. Wonder how many more little things happened forgotten in time. Through early 2014, you were working initially on C++ and later Go. How many working on Go in 2014?

SPEAKER_00: Really just a few around Jeff. Mainly designer and Alex van de Sande from Brazil.

SPEAKER_01: You were second team member? Correct. First paid one I'm not sure. Came roughly same time as Alex and Felix in terms of employment. When working earlier, started, were there others working on Go Ethereum ahead of joining?

SPEAKER_00: Not really, you were among first contributors. Nick Saber was around, super tall little dude. Going together to Bitcoin conference in Amsterdam April 2014. Met Vitalik there, talked quite a bit, nice party, nice time.

SPEAKER_01: Nick Sabers a name seen a lot never met or spoken to him. Around a lot early then disappeared, bit of a non-guy. Was he ever official part of any team?

SPEAKER_00: I don't think he was ever official part of any team. Always around helping. Employed by some bank. Did work on Java client as well, mainly by Roman Mandelik who mysteriously disappeared after few years. Saw him on Facebook for quite a time. Not sure what happened to him. Remember speaking to him at London DEFCON, definitely around DEVCON0 with whole EthereumJ team, Ethercamp.

SPEAKER_01: Early 2017 he disappeared. They did Hacker Gold, some controversy about buying votes but paid out anyway. Some think he exit scammed. Not convinced, if he did it was worst exit scam ever, so early no big money. Definitely unreliable. Mentioned collaborative sub-team, Ethersphere, wishful thinking. Registered as organization on GitHub. At that time only Aaron Justice Harris who later became Monax. Ethosphere home of most work committing through that to codebase. Yourself, Daniel Nagy, Zoltan Felföldi. On Devcon0? Defcon0 confirmed. For Danny and me joining, by that time quite a bit of buzz around him.

SPEAKER_00: Can you say a bit about Swarm? Some ideas went long way back.

SPEAKER_01: Yes, in May 2014 there was a seminar trial of talks in East London, first appearance of Web3 in Ethereum context. Founders realized decentralization can extend to support entire web backend. Extend to data, app data, hosting, put data layer on top, messaging. Conceive as world computer with holy trinity: Ethereum blockchain as CPU, Swarm as disk, Whisper as messaging. Mentioned East London meetups, Theo even had co-working office there often found Vitalik. Internal meetings. Famous diagram surface? Yes, circle with apps coming in side, including QML, Qt anticipated tech platforms. Web3 born, crazy protocol names like Ð after ETH, Icelandic thorn letter. Sub-protocols running on common basis, Ethereum one of many related protocols. Why I was dedicated to Ethereum, understood Turing-complete computation secured with blockchain. Envisioned change in how internet works with Swarm, Whisper. Liked the idea. Later learned some like Dani operating DC++ node had legal troubles. Maybe talk about this with him sometime.

SPEAKER_00: Zoltan mentioned idea for Swarm went back to at least 2011.

SPEAKER_01: Mainly his idea seeing BitTorrent amazing works but drawbacks. Historically best derive Swarm from BitTorrent. BitTorrent had difficulty starting downloads with throttling, improper incentives keeping data, individual file bits not addressable needing tracker. Legal prosecution in Germany for torrent users later. Dani trying to give idea chunking, chunks content addressable, chunk placement part of DHT. DHT decentralized hash table puts node IDs and chunk IDs in same space, get information about chunks from neighborhoods with same address, iterate through peers using logarithmic distance. Not very private, not deniable, enforce chunks reside put layer on top. Genius idea called DPA Decentralized Preimage Archive. Storing data at place in DHT direct interpretation, important notion became important. Sitting in Arena Plaza Budapest winter 2014/15 with Fefe talking about implementing using UDP considered TCP too heavy slow. Suggested using TCP with forwarding keep alive connections, Kademlia through live connections forwarding request backward chunk. Easy to implement, one of best interesting choices of Swarm allowing peer-to-peer accounting, privacy features. Originator of request unknown when asking to watch Star Wars solves opportunistic caching problem distributing popular content retrieval paths forwarders remember chunks. Ideas coalesced 2016, first release PhiLix Wintermeyer in Geth 1.5 December 2016 Alpha Public pilot released video streaming tweets about that.

SPEAKER_00: Primary thought with Swarm was holy trinity: decentralized compute database blockchain, Swarm decentralized file system storage, Whisper decentralized messaging. Synergy hosting web front end, application wrapping around smart contracts transactions. Decentralized storage mechanism storing HTML JavaScript etc. Incentive system keeping stuff available avoiding tragedy of commons only most popular content available. Building on Ethereum cryptocurrency for incentives, smart contract system implementing intensive incentive systems. Holistic unstoppable whole applications cannot be stopped full stack.

SPEAKER_01: Sad lot of stuff dependent on centralized hosted services. Bitbase lost biggest crypto heist hacked dev's account uploaded through S3 making safe wallet use. Much more difficult if content address registered. Blockchain source of truth ENS services name resolving to content hash retrieved from Swarm decentralized stores. 2016 era ENS coming to life, important part. Nick Johnson first part of Swarm team developing ENS later pivoted to ENS. Didn't know he worked on Swarm? Yes recruited him, part of community very valuable contribution.

SPEAKER_00: Check timeline, started February 2016 Nick Johnson June same time as Hudson. Greg Colvin March Everton Fraga April, Hudson Jamie Picks Nick Johnson all June 2016. Talking DEFCON0 November 2014 Berlin, first time meet quite number people?

SPEAKER_01: Absolutely memorable meeting Alex Leverington, interesting discussions. He was adamant stubborn own way thinking protocol much more knowledgeable trying learn from him. Also trying be pragmatic savvy simplify. Wrote specs protp2p protocol not really followed.

SPEAKER_00: Libp2p existed as part Protocol Labs IPFS. Ethereum suffered not invented here syndrome. RLP RLPx stuff own serialization protocol protp2p lean protocol excellent purposes including in this form less bloated but problems maintenance not appropriate start Satyrn build everything from scratch retrospect probably not best idea. Execution clients stuck libp2p forever, consensus clients libp2p not RLP. Discussions 2016 both protocols bridge protocol relay nodes libp2p run browser devp2p never run browser. Working Parity team Robert try light client browser talking things never quite happened decisions left forever only after left foundation switched peer-to-peer as well started B client development. Devcon0 late 2014 things continued through 2015 July launch Swarm just idea Danny had interesting past decentralized storage presented vision watched interest slowly organically became subteam Pepper never contributed first bit Jeff told him just working gas. Incentivized lifetime protocol worked many years sad never took off.

SPEAKER_00: My interest started wanting run Ethereum node smartwatch ARM Linux cross builds CPP Ethereum thought full client working devices light clients come out work testnet full client time everything scale phones routers media boxes Linux distros background service just work network stack audio stack consensus stack cheap easy didn't happen 10 years DBoot project boot Swarm UFI client bring operating systems interesting networking stuff happen bootstrap mini OS small Linux environment critical moved bandwidth.

SPEAKER_01: Through early years prior Mainnet launch Swarm work yellow paper determination feature complete good enough look like?

SPEAKER_00: No clear idea took while understand full system only Jeff really building massive things single-handedly assigned task building block pool taking blocks clients building header chain validating working lot always Jeff had enough just build couple days done interesting experience Christoph Jentzsch building cross-client tests. July 2015 arrival Ming Chan soon after budget cuts foundation burned through vast majority money austerities Vitalik said Swarm not small use IPFS start working incentive system Jeff let keep working notes period ready incentivization scheme bandwidth incentives Swarm decentralized storage systems proper bandwidth positive storage incentives privacy properties advanced framework addressing URL-based addressing rest storage balanced distribution chunks monetary incentives drives bottom up altruism rational profit-maximizing agent maximizing profit emerges intelligent system serve purposes Ethereum express smart contracts self-enforcing contracts beautiful incentive system strategic decision clients make not lead immediate disconnect syntax problem primitive violation incentivized extent doing else protocol dictates not better rewards lose money connectivity connect forward serve strategies retrieve cache properly incentivized.

SPEAKER_01: Looking back 10 years things happened thought might Ethereum become reflections journey. Theme still close heart fulfills early promises maturing slower than wanted Proof Stake supposed come few years happened 2022 some things take while develop conceptualize properly earlier ambitions proper apps Swarm Ethereum apps materialize Web 3.0 app weak link not decentralized stack Tornado Cash using Infura block Tornado Cash point obviously illegal US suffer early neglects neglecting clients proofs verification surprising Web3 talk PC centralized NFTs Moxie Marlinspike blog post Poka fun poke fun promise Swarm missed lagging ecosystem promises lament share positive energies constructive action punk optimistic unstoppable unstoppable now slow down hope people listen stupid regulations curbing use instead go okay thank you very much lovely talk reminisce past too okay thank much bye.
