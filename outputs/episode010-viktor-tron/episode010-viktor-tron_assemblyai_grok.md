**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** So, hello, I am Bob Summerwill and this is Early Days of Ethereum with my good friend Viktor Trón. So, hi Viktor, how are you?

**[00:15] SPEAKER_01:** Very, very well, thank you. Hello Bob. Thank you for inviting me to the show. It's wonderful to reminisce.

**[00:30] SPEAKER_00:** Well, great to have you here. So, yeah, we bumped into each other in Buenos Aires for Devcon and had hoped to record there but for one reason or another that never happened. So good to connect online instead. So talking about early days of Ethereum, you were very early in Ethereum. So I mean what were you doing in your life prior to that that led you to the project.

**[01:00] SPEAKER_01:** Work wise? I was not exactly, I wouldn't say I was exactly very close to the crypto scene to be honest. I was working on a project with BBC News Labs News Juicer project. It was trying to kind of ingest a lot of new sources like from old photo archives, video archives and everything and kind of use it like basically work through the speech recognition and everything and categorized it and made it searchable in a very nice way. I mean of course it's one of these kind of BBC sponsored projects no one really needed and it was never really used but it was a nice project to work on and anyway, so I kind of left the job.

**[01:45] SPEAKER_00:** At that time you were in London, you were living in London?

**[01:50] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I was in London. I was living in London and I left the job because I found Ethereum. I was very excited right away. So when, I guess it was when Gavin visited this kind of new web meetup some sort, I think it was a new web meetup and then presented Ethereum, I was absolutely taken aback and I found it was amazing and a game changer. And I mean what led me to it to be honest was I was already quite a bit into Bitcoin which is kind of interesting because Bitcoin came into my life through a friend who I knew from an anarchist club or like Facebook group basically. So he introduced me to it on ideological grounds but of course I was very interested in tech as well. But it took me quite a while to understand what is blockchain, how all these things come together. But by that time I was kind of solid in understanding of the blockchain and my knowledge was solid enough so that I could question Gavin and Vitalik and say it's absolutely not going to work obviously because of this halting problem. And bit by bit when I understood that they all had answers to every question that I can ever think of, then that's when I got to admit that they are probably the geniuses I really want to look up to and have in my environment to learn from. It was a very, very great start. And so when Gavin presented Ethereum I was, next day I was already hacking on the C codebase actually and my first PR in. We kind of met in a cafe in Dalston I think. And I remember I was quite impressed that Gavin used Mac but actually was running Linux on it. That was very impressive.

**[03:30] SPEAKER_00:** And so you mentioned your anarchist group there. So had Bitcoin earlier been interesting to you from that kind of monetary, anarchist, libertarian perspective.

**[03:45] SPEAKER_01:** I mean when Bitcoin came, this was the time when I even kind of learned what money was really. I mean before I didn't even grasp this notion. And it was very important times in my life. It was really a game changer to kind of have a framework in which I can totally identify myself with. Yeah, I don't know if it's the right word, but freedom-seeking individual and I really like this kind of Austrian view of economy and have understood what money was used and what inflation was I never really understood before. I came late to the game, let's say. But yeah, and then it was all history after.

**[04:30] SPEAKER_00:** And the next web meeting that you mentioned was that like a recurring meetup that you were going to or were you regularly going to kind of web meetups?

**[04:45] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, but this one I particularly sought out because I saw Vitalik's presentation I think in Miami and so that really got me interested. So I knew what I was in for when I showed up on that meeting in Hoxton Square I think it was.

**[05:00] SPEAKER_00:** Sorry, you said Vitalik's presentation, was that the one that he'd given in Miami?

**[05:05] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, exactly. And so I knew already what to expect from it, but of course I never really understood and Gavin helped me quite a bit to understand it. So it was really great.

**[05:20] SPEAKER_00:** Had you been watching a variety of like Bitcoin conference talks? Was that a sort of regular thing that you were doing at that point? Watching.

**[05:30] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, watching YouTube? Yes, and I was very, very interested and very much into these things. I mean, I was hoping that changes related to this kind of technologies would come a lot earlier. I was already kind of sort of hyped a bit or contributed to it myself in a way.

**[05:50] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, had you been sort of following along with things like Mastercoin and Colored Coins and other sort of Bitcoin 2.0 projects?

**[06:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, actually I did. Yeah. It was kind of at the point.

**[06:05] SPEAKER_00:** I'm sorry.

**[06:06] SPEAKER_01:** And there was BitShares, I think.

**[06:10] SPEAKER_00:** Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[06:12] SPEAKER_01:** And there was this kind of open transactions which was very close to Gavin's heart, I think. He worked with them together. Yeah, I don't know what came out of that, but interesting. And then so after I left the BBC and that winter which I spent in Thailand, half in a retreat and then in my spare time I was working on the yellow paper and worked my way through the really hard notation that Gavin put on paper.

**[06:45] SPEAKER_00:** Yes. A lot of people struggled with that sort of math-heavy notation and so you went to Gav's presentation which was, would have been very early February. So I mean that was only like a week or so after Vitalik's presentation in Miami. It would have been very, very close.

**[07:05] SPEAKER_01:** Correct.

**[07:06] SPEAKER_00:** So you spoke to Gav there and then you exchanged emails, did you?

**[07:10] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, basically we exchanged emails. He put me on a Skype group. There was a Skype group at the time, I think it was 20 odd people on it. Really not a big crowd and yeah, that's how it all started. So very nice in the beginning to have this kind of grandiose ideas and chat and be part of it. I'm super proud and very happy that I managed to be at the forefront of it. It was kind of a lucky move to be honest.

**[07:45] SPEAKER_00:** So was it a fair bit later in that year that you started working with Danny on Swarm? Were you doing.

**[07:55] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Then it came a little bit later. So first of all in the spring I started working on the yellow paper and then a bit on the C. Not a lot. And then I think it was in March or sometime that I showed up on the first Ethereum meetup. Maybe not the first. I think you told me it was not the first but the second one in London.

**[08:20] SPEAKER_00:** This is.

**[08:21] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes, yes.

**[08:22] SPEAKER_00:** So this was organized by Stephan Tual.

**[08:25] SPEAKER_01:** There was Mihai there who later I think. And then.

**[08:30] SPEAKER_00:** Sorry, Mihai Alisie. Was that right?

**[08:35] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes. And I think who I talked to quite a lot was Jack du Rose, who then.

**[08:45] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, of Colony.

**[08:46] SPEAKER_01:** Colony fame. Exactly. So. And then there is when I met Jeff first. So Jeff became my boss later.

**[08:55] SPEAKER_00:** He came to London for that meetup.

**[08:57] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes, he did.

**[08:58] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[08:59] SPEAKER_01:** And that's when I kind of saw that it's quite an international crowd and from all over the world kind of doing this thing. So I kind of started to take it very seriously. As I said, I kind of left my job and joined the ranks and I kind of started contributing to the Go code. And so after that I was really into Golang. That's where I contributed most and became part of the Geth team after Jeff offered me the job around September, October that year when the foundation was already actively paying out some salaries or recruiting people on the teams.

**[09:45] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, so I mean I was looking at the timing on that. So the Ethereum Foundation was founded in July of 2014 and then the crowd sale was going through July, August, September. And then yeah, the hiring, that first wave of we've actually got some money to hire people was sort of September, October.

**[10:10] SPEAKER_01:** In October I was negotiating it with Aeron Buchanan, I remember. He was my contact then. And then I don't know when the Amsterdam office in Waterlooplein was actually founded, but I already visited Jeff later in that year there. And then when I first kind of joined, I was talking to my semi with my friends in Hungary. Some of them related to this Facebook group and among them like Dániel Fehér. And there was another person who's very close to Swarm later but never actually entered the scene officially. Let's let him be unnamed. And so there was some thinking that maybe the four of us kind of can form a group and we can just join as a kind of sub dev team or something. It never happened. So we were hired individually. And then yes, around later that year, there was the Devcon 0. Is that correct?

**[11:15] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah. I mean if we just pop back a little bit. So could you say, through 2014, prior to the sale and so on, I mean, so how were things working early in 2014? I mean, you mentioned a Skype group. Were most people kind of working through Skype?

**[11:35] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes, it was really mainly everything was done by basically Gavin, Jeff and Vitalik. The rest of us were just sharpers on the way at that time and then kind of just tapping up. I mean I'm talking about the technical stuff. I'm really not sure about the admin and the foundation stuff so hope no offense is taken from anyone but yeah for the tech stuff it's yeah. So I think it was actually in July that Jeff shared a kind of PoC theme to do with me and introduced me into the intricacies of the then aspiring dev p2p protocol. And so I think that was my first project that was really kind of in the codebase that was then later scraped and completely rewritten by Felix and the other guys. But that was my first attempt. I think that to be a networking layer at the time I was kind of trying to say really crazy ideas to Jeff about some developer tooling some contract verification kind of like staging and like fake blockchain environment and stuff. And he was adamant that there are other things to do and he was focusing on like maybe the end user applications like at the time it was the Ethco I think it was under Ethco but actually later the Mist browser basically. It was a browser and so he was kind of trying to talk me out of it and said that the other group the C team is assigned to that anyway so let me not tread unwanted paths. And so he kind of brought me back to.

**[13:30] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, well I mean he had Aleth. You had Alethzero, right? Alethzero I guess was an earlier kind of incarnation of that.

**[13:40] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that's right. And then but there was some not so glorious tasks as well that I refactored logging and things like this I remember in the early days but there was also a time when I was learning Golang because it was also not a super popular language I think a lot of learning to do and yeah.

**[14:00] SPEAKER_00:** I mean it was relatively new at that point, Go. So you'd mentioned the yellow paper. So in those very early months of 2014 Gav in particular seemed to be incredibly productive in terms of what he was getting through with the C client and that yellow paper back. I mean was it usually the code that was leading and then the yellow paper was being kind of modeled after that.

**[14:30] SPEAKER_01:** It's hard for me to say if they really were hand in hand developing. I can't really tell. Maybe it's better to ask him to be honest but yes the productivity and the speed that he was churning out code was absolutely stunning. So it's like already a few months after some of these clients already worked. But yeah, to be honest, Jeff was the same and Jeff was also incredible in his productivity. These people were really nice examples in front of us. So I was really happy to learn from them in a way. Yeah.

**[15:15] SPEAKER_00:** And I mean I think that triangulation was so important right of having multiple clients and the spec and you had the Python client though not really to that production status but those three groups all.

**[15:30] SPEAKER_01:** Who's the now glorious statement that Ethereum always was very proud of that this multi-client development was leading to very, very solid specs. It's actually true. But of course that was not the reason. The reason was that all these brilliant individuals just followed their own favorite language and just wanted their own clients to build. But ultimately what came out of it is amazing like the specification. I just remember just a few times that the specification had to be changed. There's like one case when there was a modular operation that was not exactly minus, I think it was minus number exactly not sure. There was another one I think it was around Easter 2015 whereas before in the year leading to the launch. And I think that was when there was kind of problem that the uncle had. Two uncles had the same timestamp I think and that led to a fork. I remember I wrote up a kind of blog post about this and never published it. So interesting.

**[16:45] SPEAKER_00:** Talking to Jakob Jentzsch. So he was an intern at the Berlin office in 2015 but he was telling me about a hard fork that had happened on the mainnet around two weeks or so after launching, which I was completely unaware of. But then looking back, there was a sort of security announcement by Jutta was a patching of the Geth client. And while I've been doing stuff myself in terms of like running old clients, I saw that as well. If you run Geth 1.0.0 or Geth 1.0.1, it gets stuck. It can't go through Frontier blocks. So it was actually a hard fork.

**[17:30] SPEAKER_01:** Do you remember what it was related to? It was not that uncle thing that you remembered.

**[17:35] SPEAKER_00:** I mean it was some kind of gas counting or something, some kind of little bug. But that was funny. That was a thing that I was not aware about because I so it was a hard fork but it was never given a name because it was just an accident.

**[17:55] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, sure.

**[17:56] SPEAKER_00:** And you wonder how many more of these little things there were that happened that sort of forgotten in the mists of time. Yes, but yeah, so I mean through that early 2014 year you were working initially on the C and then later on the Go. I mean how many people were working on Go in 2014?

**[18:20] SPEAKER_01:** I mean it was really just a few people around. Jeff I think was mainly designer and Alex van de Sande from Brazil and yeah, and who after him.

**[18:35] SPEAKER_00:** But you were the second team member then, is that right?

**[18:40] SPEAKER_01:** Correct, just about. Or maybe actually the first officially, I'm not sure. The first paid one, I'm not sure but I mean we came roughly at the same time with Alex and with Felix Lange, definitely.

**[18:55] SPEAKER_00:** Right, yeah. In terms of employment. Yeah but I meant when you were working earlier, when you started there, I mean were there other people working on that Go Ethereum ahead of your joining in with him?

**[19:10] SPEAKER_01:** Not really. Not really. So he was pretty much the one that contributed the code as far as I remember. And I mean there was quite a vibrant community of people there like the later became Slock.it, there was like Nick Savers around like super tall dude and we were going together to the Bitcoin conference I think it was in April.

**[19:40] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, you went to Toronto?

**[19:42] SPEAKER_01:** No, no, it was Amsterdam.

**[19:45] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, okay.

**[19:46] SPEAKER_01:** And that's when I had the chance to really talk to Vitalik quite a bit. It was very nice and I got big parted as well. So nice time.

**[19:55] SPEAKER_00:** Nick Savers is a name that I've seen a lot of times and I never really met or spoken to him. I guess he was around a lot early and then maybe kind of disappeared and maybe he's a little bit of an anon guy that doesn't show face.

**[20:15] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I mean he never joined. I don't think he was ever officially part of it, but he was always around and helping. I think he was employed by some bank.

**[20:25] SPEAKER_00:** But I saw he and some others did the first continuous integration, they were doing the build system and then he did work on the Java client as well.

**[20:35] SPEAKER_01:** That is true. And Java client was mainly led by what was his name? Roman Mandeleil, who kind of mysteriously disappeared after. I'm not sure what happened to him.

**[20:50] SPEAKER_00:** I did see him on Facebook for quite a time. He seems to have either disappeared or something since.

**[21:00] SPEAKER_01:** But I remember at the London Devcon 1 he was definitely around there with the whole EthJam team. Yeah, I don't know their name.

**[21:10] SPEAKER_00:** Was but Ether.camp.

**[21:12] SPEAKER_01:** That's correct. Thanks for reminding. Well, nostalgia, all these phrases.

**[21:20] SPEAKER_00:** So yeah, it was early sort of early 2017 I think that he kind of disappeared. They did Hack.ethercamp and this some kind of like hackathon that there was some controversy about. It looked like the team kind of bought votes or something but were paid out anyway. And then yeah, he sort of disappeared with some people thinking he'd exit scammed but I'm not convinced he did because if he did it was the worst exit scam ever because it was so early like wasn't like anyone had got any kind of big amount of money or anything at that point. Sort of a very poor scam.

**[22:00] SPEAKER_01:** He was definitely enabled and also committed guy.

**[22:05] SPEAKER_00:** So maybe. So you'd mentioned about your collaborative sub team. So that's EtherSphere.

**[22:15] SPEAKER_01:** Well, it's kind of wishful thinking that it might be EtherSphere but on the other hand I did register that as an organization on GitHub at least and even I think it was pretty much one of the first Ethereum-related brands in a way. I mean if I can call it a brand. I mean I think at the time it was only Eris Industries.

**[22:40] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Yeah, Eris.

**[22:42] SPEAKER_01:** Who later became Monax, this Marmot thing and they did some nice work by the way. But yeah, so EtherSphere was the home of maybe most of our work and then we kind of committed through that to the Ethereum codebase.

**[23:00] SPEAKER_00:** So that was yourself, Daniel Nagy.

**[23:05] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. And later Zsolt Felföldi like already hired to work on the light client. I think it was in 2015 already. And yeah, because he was not at Devcon 0 but yeah, Devcon 0 was already kind of. I mean there was quite a bit of buzz around him I think.

**[23:30] SPEAKER_00:** So maybe could you say a bit about Swarm? Because my understanding is that some of the ideas went an awful long way back.

**[23:40] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So I don't know if you remember there was in May 2014 there was a seminal triad of talks in I think it was in Whitechapel somewhere. And in that talk that was the first appearance of Web3 in the Ethereum context. It was always usually explained. These founders really realized how decentralization can basically also be extended to support the entire back end of the web. And basically if you extend it to data, app data and then hosting and so basically put a data layer on top and then maybe the messaging, then you can conceive of it as the world computer with this holy trinity of Ethereum blockchain as the world computer's CPU and disk would be Swarm and then Whisper would be the kind of messaging layer.

**[24:45] SPEAKER_00:** So you were mentioning Whitechapel. So that was again some meetups was it? That was happening there.

**[24:55] SPEAKER_01:** And I think maybe Ethereum even had some sort of coworking or like some sort of hideout office there, maybe a room or two because we often found Vitalik there. So not entirely sure how it looked. I don't want to say anything but yeah. A lot of internal meetings as well.

**[25:15] SPEAKER_00:** Would that have been when that kind of famous diagram would first have surfaced? You know the one with like the circle and the apps coming in at the side.

**[25:25] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, that was just about that time including QML I saw. So it was not just HTML, it was QML and Qt as other anticipated tech platforms.

**[25:40] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, that's when Web3 was born. And it's kind of the crazy protocol names like after these which is Þ which is also the lettering in Icelandic.

**[25:55] SPEAKER_00:** Oh yeah, the thorn.

**[25:57] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. And so that's when bzz and shh was invented. Also Vitalik's gimmicks.

**[26:05] SPEAKER_00:** Those Ethereum. Well, the subprotocols. Right, subprotocols running on a common basis. But that Ethereum was just one of many related protocols.

**[26:15] SPEAKER_01:** And that's why I was very dedicated to this whole Ethereum at the time. I really understood what it means to have the entire Turing-complete computation being secured on its own with the blockchain. And I really envisioned quite a change in how the internet works if you have Swarm and Whisper and all these things. So I quite liked the idea. And then later I learned that not only did we socialize on BitTorrent at the time and kind of wanted to improve it, but actually some of us like Danny operating a DC hub had some legal troubles maybe, maybe you can talk about this with him at some point. So that's kind of brought him quite directly in the realm of implementing Swarm. This idea of a decentralized storage and incentivization etc. And name resolution all connected.

**[27:15] SPEAKER_00:** And Zsolt had mentioned to me that he thought that the idea for Swarm had gone back to at least 2011.

**[27:25] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, so there was this idea, of course I don't know about that, but it was mainly Danny's idea that he saw the amazing qualities of BitTorrent, but he also saw some drawbacks. So maybe historically it's best to derive the whole idea of Swarm from them. Because BitTorrent had difficulty like starting a download, there's all this kind of noise and throttling rules. And of course didn't have the proper incentives to keep the data. And also of course had the problem with the individual bits of the file not being addressable right away. You had to use a tracker to resolve them. And of course there's also a problem with the privacy in BitTorrent. Because I mean, as you remember, for example in Germany there was legal prosecution for people who used BitTorrent.

**[28:30] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, I didn't know that.

**[28:32] SPEAKER_01:** And I mean not at the time, but much later, but yeah. So I think what Danny was trying to do is came up with an idea of how to chunk things in a way every chunk is content addressable and also that some of the placement of chunks is also part of the DHT. So normally a DHT like a distributed hash table is basically the idea that you put node IDs and then chunk IDs of content basically in the same space and somehow you get information what's the location, like who to download it from about these chunks from neighborhoods that have the same address or similar address. So there's usually a metric on this. If you use the XOR distance like that, then you can work with Kademlia networks. You kind of iterate through the peers like you keep a few peers connected and you go closer one to this guy to this hash of Star Wars and you want to watch Star Wars and then you hop and ultimately you see where the chunks are you can download from. Obviously this is not very private. And also it's not very deniable. And if you enforce certain chunks should reside so you kind of enforce a kind of orange layer on top of it, then you can probably deny that you know anything about the system that enforces that parts of Star Wars reside. Basically it was Danny's genius idea that I think we call it the DPA. Distributed preimage archive. So basically an archive of preimages. Preimage is a bit of data that the image of is the hash. The preimage is what's before the hashing the actual piece of the data. And so this idea of actually storing not the location but the actual data at the place in the DHT has direct interpretation was the DPA. And that was a very important notion that came and then became very important in Swarm. And then yeah, and then a lot of other things came. So I remember that we were in 2015 or fourth quarter and that winter day we were sitting in the Aréna Plaza in Budapest the three of us with Fefe talking about this and how to start implementing because there was a pressure to obviously implement the whole thing with using UDP as the networking stack because it was considered that TCP is too heavy and too slow. But then obviously at the time you already had the devp2p it's very easy to implement it and then try this protocol. So I suggested that maybe instead of using UDP just use TCP but use forwarding keep alive some connections persistent connections with the peers and just use the Kademlia through the live connections that each forwarding like each locally decided to forward to the closer node and ultimately move backward. Like you forward the request and you back forward the chunk after all. And so it seemed very easy to implement. And we did exactly that. Turned out to be one of the best and most interesting choices of Swarm. It turns out that that's what allows the peer-to-peer accounting to be working. And also this gives the privacy features that Swarm has basically obfuscates the originator of the request. If you think about it, no one knows that. When someone downstream is asking you something and they want to watch Star Wars or someone upstream wants to watch and also it directly solved the opportunistic caching problem, how to distribute automatically popular content. So with the retrieval paths all the forwarding peers can just remember some of the chunks. So it's very interesting how these ideas started and then basically coalesced in 2016 Swarm I think, the first very first release Swarm in Geth 1.5 or something so it was December 2016. Yes, the public alpha was released and I remember there was already kind of how we viewed video. We call it streaming but it's actually not real-time streaming. It's just watch the video file. There was a nice tweet about that too.

**[33:30] SPEAKER_00:** And just to take a step back, so I mean my understanding of a primary thought that there was with Swarm was that because you could have this holy trinity right of decentralized compute with the blockchain Swarm for the decentralized file system and storage and then Whisper for that decentralized messaging that you could have this really nice kind of synergy of say a primary issue which is still really not solved of saying well how do you host the web front end to make a whole application? Yes you need your smart contracts and your transactions and things but you need an application wrapping around that. So really the thought that if you had a decentralized storage mechanism that could store like the HTML and the JavaScript and so on that you want like an incentive system so that that stuff is available if people want it. You know that you don't have a tragedy of the commons where only most popular content is available. But also because if you are building on Ethereum you've got the cryptocurrency to do the incentives you've got the smart contract system that allows you to implement those incentive systems and all of these things can fit together into a holistic unstoppable whole of saying well here you go you've got your applications which cannot be stopped but that's the full stack. And it seems even now that there's an awful lot of stuff which is dependent on centralized hosted services and it's very central.

**[35:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sad about this to be honest. I mean there's a lot of these things like I don't know if you remember this big, was it Safe? That was the biggest crypto heist ever because of the Safe hack. If that had been using Swarm then it was much more difficult to change all these kind of transactions under the hood because what they had to do is they hacked the dev's account and then uploaded something through S3 which then the Safe wallet used. And of course these are much more difficult to do if these things are content addressed of course registered. This is how these things work. Like you start from the blockchain which is that single source of truth like ENS resolves a name, you resolve it to content hash and then the content hash is retrieved from these decentralized stores.

**[36:00] SPEAKER_00:** And I mean again that 2016 kind of era was when ENS was coming to life as well. So yeah I mean that's another thing actually.

**[36:10] SPEAKER_01:** Nick Johnson was first part of the Swarm team. He developed ENS and then later took off.

**[36:20] SPEAKER_00:** I didn't know he worked on Swarm. I knew he was part of the Geth team. But he did some Swarm as well eh?

**[36:30] SPEAKER_01:** Well definitely yeah I recruited him to be honest.

**[36:35] SPEAKER_00:** Fantastic. Did you know him in London?

**[36:40] SPEAKER_01:** No no no. He was just part of the community. Valuable contributions to Geth after that.

**[36:50] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah let me just check the timeline. But I think he got hired really pretty soon after me. I started in February 2016 and I think he was maybe June same kind of time as Hudson. Yeah let's see. So yeah I started in February Greg Colvin in March Everton Fraga in April.

**[37:10] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah.

**[37:11] SPEAKER_00:** And yeah June. Both Hudson and Jamie Pitts and Nick Johnson all June 2016. What was I going to mention? So yeah you talked about Devcon 0. So that was November 2014 in Berlin I imagine. Was that the first time that you would have met quite a number of these people.

**[37:35] SPEAKER_01:** Especially special memory is my meeting with Alex Leverington. Oh yes the devp2p fame. Yeah very interesting. We had lots of discussions. Yeah very adamant very stubborn with his own way of thinking about the protocol. I have to say he was much more knowledgeable than I was at the time. So I was just trying to learn a lot from him. But at the same time I was trying to be a bit more pragmatic and trying to simplify. I remember I first basically brought together the kind of specs for the devp2p protocol then and then that was not really followed just right. Yeah.

**[38:30] SPEAKER_00:** Well I mean the other the other piece there is that libp2p as part of the Protocol Labs IPFS that already existed at that time. So that was kind of interesting right this whole devp2p libp2p.

**[38:45] SPEAKER_01:** I mean you know how Ethereum kind of suffered this not invented here syndrome and like the RLP stuff.

**[38:55] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[38:56] SPEAKER_01:** Then we have their own serialization protocol like devp2p as well. I have to say that devp2p at some point was kind of a lean party protocol.

**[39:05] SPEAKER_00:** Right excellent.

**[39:06] SPEAKER_01:** For the purposes of including into Swarm it's less bloated. But of course it had a lot of problems in terms of maintenance. I mean it was just not appropriate to start and build everything from scratch. In retrospect it was probably not the best idea to be honest.

**[39:25] SPEAKER_00:** And I mean that's got then that's got stuck in the execution clients forever. You know that the consensus clients now are using libp2p and aren't using RLP anymore but the execution clients got stuck with devp2p forever. And I mean I remember having discussions with various people on this in sort of 2016 of saying well could you have both protocols you know people looking at sort of could you do a bridge protocol so that some of the stuff could run over libp2p and you could have like relay nodes really with the thought that with libp2p you could run in a browser. Right you know devp2p you could never run in a browser. And so Guillaume was working with somebody from the Parity team maybe Robert around or maybe a little later 2017 2018 of trying to see well can we get a light client in browser talking to all of these things but never quite happened. Some of these decisions just last forever.

**[40:45] SPEAKER_01:** It was only after we left the foundation is when we switched to libp2p as well started B client development.

**[40:55] SPEAKER_00:** Right right. I was yeah I wasn't aware that that transition had happened. So I mean Devcon 0. So that was late 2014. But things continued obviously through 2015 all the way up.

**[41:10] SPEAKER_01:** Swarm was just an idea which was kind of mainly meant to be specced out or kind of started by Danny who had this very interesting past with decentralized storage and he actually presented his vision of that at Devcon 0 yeah everyone watch it very good early capturing of this idea after that.

**[41:35] SPEAKER_00:** And at that point he got hired in and that became a real thread of official development within the Ethereum stack.

**[41:45] SPEAKER_01:** Absolutely correct. And then later as time went by gathered around him and continued on churning out some code around Danny. And then slowly organically became a little bit of a sub team after that and yeah and so after that like never really contributed the first bit which he which was even I think he was even programmed on before Ethereum.

**[42:15] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah as you said he was telling me that he was thinking that was what he would be doing when he was hired in but then almost immediately Jeff told him yeah no you're not you're just working on Geth.

**[42:30] SPEAKER_01:** Yes yes. I mean you signed for to develop the incentivized file transfer protocol he worked on for many many years and it's a bit sad that it never took off to be honest but there's been a lot of things.

**[42:45] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah well I mean it's tough. I mean that's where my own journey started because when I got interested in Ethereum the first thing I wanted to do was I was really into mobile and wearables at that time so I wanted to see can I run an Ethereum node on my smartwatch? So I was doing ARM Linux cross builds of cpp-ethereum and my thought at that time was okay light client is still getting worked out but I'll get a full client working on all these devices and then when light client comes out they'll just work right? So I can run a full client on a testnet make sure it all works. But it's just a matter of time. Of course we'll have light clients and of course everything will scale and of course you can run all things on any devices right? We're thinking every phone is you're just going to have an Ethereum node running every router media box.

**[43:45] SPEAKER_01:** We're still suffering the kind of RPC and centralized access right? How unstoppable is that?

**[43:55] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah it will just get you know it will just come with every Linux distro you know it'll just be like a service that's just part of the Linux distro just get shipped. You've just got this background service that is just talking Ethereum and it'd be the same as having a network stack or an audio stack or whatever. It's just yeah you're going to have a consensus stack and it'll just run in the background and just work cheap and easy. Yeah not no that didn't quite happen.

**[44:30] SPEAKER_01:** And then 10 years in it's kind of maybe things are starting like I don't know if you know the Etherboot project for example.

**[44:40] SPEAKER_00:** No. What's that?

**[44:42] SPEAKER_01:** How to boot from Swarm basically.

**[44:45] SPEAKER_00:** Booting from Swarm.

**[44:47] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. I mean they are building this kind of UEFI client that can bring up any operating system.

**[44:55] SPEAKER_00:** Wow okay. That's interesting.

**[45:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yes interesting. I mean it's not worked out fully yet but the guys are on it.

**[45:05] SPEAKER_00:** I mean there's a fair bit of networking stuff that would have to happen before you could even start right. Like that's having to have some kind of bootstrapping little mini OS or something.

**[45:15] SPEAKER_01:** It seems that even before that you can do it just yeah I mean they already have that kind of kernel a small Linux environment is created and they boot from that. That's interesting. And they can do it just with the network.

**[45:30] SPEAKER_00:** So I mean through those early years prior to mainnet launch you'd mentioned work on the yellow paper so I mean how was it being determined what feature complete what good enough looks like you know have you got a good idea of what you'd have to have before launch could happen?

**[45:50] SPEAKER_01:** I mean well I didn't have a clear idea really because it took me a while to understand the systems I'm very honest with you. It's like I think it's only Jeff who really understood what was needed to be built and he was building massive things on his own single-handedly. It's really crazy. I remember when it was one of the not so willing tasks that I was assigned the task of building the block pool which was supposed to be the one that takes the blocks from the other clients builds up the header chain and kind of validates it etc. And I was working a lot on that and I remember he had enough and said okay I just build it and basically in one or two days it was done. Interesting experience.

**[46:45] SPEAKER_00:** And Christoph Jentzsch was building the cross-client tests as well. Did you do work with those tests yourselves?

**[46:55] SPEAKER_01:** I mean no I did myself but yeah I remember it was always he was always running and he found a lot of things through that.

**[47:05] SPEAKER_00:** So in July 2015 we had the arrival of Ming Chan and shortly afterwards pretty serious budget cuts because within that year or so the foundation had managed to pretty much burn through the vast majority of the money.

**[47:25] SPEAKER_01:** Austerity I think was the official name of that. Yeah I remember at the time when Vitalik basically said that Swarm is not going to be Swarm. What's going to be is maybe some maybe we just kind of use IPFS and let's try to work on the incentive system that we can put on that.

**[47:45] SPEAKER_00:** Okay.

**[47:46] SPEAKER_01:** And I mean I remember that maybe it's not a secret anymore but Jeff let us keep working on Swarm throughout this period so we did and very soon after we had a basically ready incentivization scheme for the bandwidth incentives. It's also very interesting because Swarm seems to be one of the only decentralized storage systems that has a proper bandwidth incentive in a proper accounting system like this swap for that accounting and it seems like it's quite I don't know probably conjectured but it doesn't look like there's any other proper way to do this because if you think about bandwidth first of all it's a kind of instant gratification thing. You either forward for someone like you either serve a request or not. So it's not like the shady territory of a future promise like storage you have to then record your deal on the chain and some proof of availability etc. But bandwidth is much more easier solved by just peer-to-peer accounting that you know I forward for you you forward for me and we check each other and if there's a big tilt then some sort of conversation should happen but naturally maybe not even has to be some settlement just. And then we kind of liked this idea that's also genius that came up in this checkbook idea. It's a very early version of vacuum sort of payment channel micropayment solution and yeah so that bandwidth incentive was a very powerful one lived on long and I remember that seemed that the incentivization for storage was much more difficult the way to arrive at there was the negative incentives to solve the problem of sybil pricing and the growth and who's responsible for what and if everything is recorded on chain how to keep the privacy of things. It's very difficult. So it came much much later and kind of worked out. We got that part as well. It was only after even the token the Swarm token was released 2021. Yeah. Anyway so yeah going back to the roots the austerity.

**[50:30] SPEAKER_00:** So you were continuing to work through late 2015 even though it had supposedly been defunded?

**[50:40] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah yeah kind of yes. I mean we were trying to figure out this incentive of course and in that sense we were not really off track in a way but. And I was also working at the time on the Geth client on many aspects of it. And by 2017 the kind of Swarm client was integrated and was released within Geth. It was in 2018 when this kind of proof of concept release was part of Geth. And it's kind of when the Swarm client was starting you start the standalone Swarm.

**[51:30] SPEAKER_00:** Starting 2018 you said.

**[51:35] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah proof of concept 3.

**[51:37] SPEAKER_00:** So all the way through until that point you were continuing to work as a Geth team member.

**[51:45] SPEAKER_01:** Yes I mean officially we were part of the yes the team part of the Ethereum entity and yeah slowly extending the team as the protocol got some movement. So yeah it was interesting times because I remember in 2016 when after Nick Johnson left he hired some other people on the protocol and then yeah that's when I emerged as the team lead at the time kind of organically trying to pull together the threads and.

**[52:20] SPEAKER_00:** So with the Swarm Foundation how and when did that happen and how did you come to leave the Geth team I guess.

**[52:30] SPEAKER_01:** Well since 2018 autumn actually 2018 summer and a person called Albert Ni started to offer help for Swarm. They were kind of asking what we need. They seemed very helpful.

**[52:45] SPEAKER_00:** And that's Albert Ni who had basically joined the Ethereum Foundation at the same time as Aya.

**[52:55] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah yeah I am very very good terms with Ming and before so. But when Albert came he seemed very helpful and tried to solve some staffing problems and things. But then negotiations started and after that it seems that by Prague we kind of got into some serious discussions and then. I think it was right at the last day of the Prague Devcon we submitted the proposal for funding and that was very interesting because I never really got any serious feedback on that and always a bit wondered what could have happened. And then there was some issues with Shaun O'Connor as the point of contact delegated by Aya.

**[53:50] SPEAKER_00:** Who.

**[53:51] SPEAKER_01:** Shaun O'Connor.

**[53:53] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[53:54] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. There was the delegated point of contact for us the Swarm team. And then slowly like after that I think the EF scores changed a bit and that's when every team needed to submit a proposal and things that's when this whole scheme started of trying to graduate some of the teams and some of the protocols out of the foundation yeah have them get individual funding and bridge the gap with some grants. And then that's what happened with Swarm as well. So I remember 2019 there was a Swarm summit in Madrid which was very successful. A lot of partnerships subscribed to some monetary help as well. But then the foundation also kind of promised to back it up and then somehow that never happened. So we kind of resorted to launching our own token which we did in 2021 and kind of already with one year into the new Swarm client like the B client and yes. So when we launched the token we started with some new life breathed into the whole thing. And that's when we started working seriously about implementing the postage storage incentives and the rest of the features just came.

**[55:30] SPEAKER_00:** I mean was that the same sort of time as your codebase became independent? Like did that kind of coincide that you're like right we're an independent thing we're going to make a new client we're going to switch to libp2p and it's not going to be integrated directly with Geth. Were those happening at the same time or did the tech happen earlier?

**[55:50] SPEAKER_01:** Yes not really. I think the Swarm codebase was taken out of Geth quite a lot before. So I think maybe 2019. I'm not even sure when but I think it was POC 4 I think. And when it was taken out I think it was time too expensive I guess or something. Anyway it's not really a good idea to mix the two. We were able to connect it's very separate and kind of separate development scheme agenda I guess.

**[56:25] SPEAKER_00:** Maybe Nick Johnson's sort of experience with spinning out ENS and the ENS foundation that would have preceded yours. So perhaps you were looking to that as a pattern. Sorry we're getting some really bad audio. Can you maybe move a little closer?

**[56:45] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. Can you hear me now?

**[56:47] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah that's better.

**[56:48] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah yeah it's very inspiring. And we did get some so we did get a grant from the foundation and also kind of bridging grant. And then as I said later somehow it never materialized with that kind of program that had budget put together with the team. But ultimately we made it. And then we had our own foundation in Switzerland which started the Swarm association and then which kind of issued the token. And yeah that a new era of development.

**[57:30] SPEAKER_00:** One thing we skipped over maybe we can just quickly go back to is Devcon 1. So that was in London in November 2015. So I assume you were there. Do you have what are your memories of that event?

**[57:45] SPEAKER_01:** I just recently rewatched it and I remember I was pretty much kind of very sick already. I don't know if you know but I was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2009 15 years ago. And when I did Devcon 1 I was not very easy to follow. And I was a bit surprised. I didn't remember at the time that was so difficult in terms of my movement. But sorry for that maybe unsolicited diversion. But yes as for the content I remember that we had a very successful presentation of Swarm. There was a lot of interest at the time.

**[58:30] SPEAKER_00:** I mean I was looking back at you're saying you're looking back I was looking back at some Devcon 1 videos recently.

**[58:40] SPEAKER_01:** Yes.

**[58:41] SPEAKER_00:** And like I guess my takeaway looking back is so many ideas were presented by that point nearly anything that you can think of in all the different areas. It seemed that somebody was working on that. You'd got this real flourishing of people building on Ethereum by that point like anything you could imagine seemingly was presented there.

**[59:10] SPEAKER_01:** I remember and I was already seeing we always thought that okay from next year we're gonna have like all these wonderful decentralized services like decentralized Deliveroo or Just Eat whatever you call it like decentralized eBay decentralized Uber and Airbnb and all kind of things and of course they all need their kind of Swarm like thing or data distribution or some sort of scalable data layer behind it that came much much later.

**[59:45] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah many of them like five or ten years too early.

**[59:50] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. And yeah so this is definitely what happened to Swarm like it did not realize much much later. Now at least it's working so so.

**[60:00] SPEAKER_00:** So yeah can you talk a little bit about where Swarm is now? What's happening? How's the functionality?

**[60:10] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah so we have quite a solid network and kind of consolidated the fairly narrow definition of the protocol. So basically it's kind of DPA or like the distributed chunk store definition where nodes communicate basically and then they distribute the chunks. It's kind of a storage model as well as content distribution network and has rather strong privacy properties which are quite unique. And really it's kind of where the analogy is I don't know you make the checkbook and postage stamp. Postage stamp is something that you attach to a chunk piece of data to keep it alive and that's kind of a hot wallet anyway that's kind of when you put some money on it some storage rent gets deducted and until it runs out of funds your content is live is available hot and yeah so I mean on the way we very early when we implemented this manifest idea the manifest basically just like mapping of strings to documents which you can use as a key value storage or a sitemap but also kind of a directory tree. Right so basically you can that way implement directories and files and so that was the first extension and we were already talking about erasure codes and stuff in 2016 and got only implemented maybe two or three years ago and it's kind of a very interesting concept of how we can implement it in the erasure codes. But yeah so there's also this kind of thing called ACT which is the access control mechanism that allows you to kind of manage the grantees that can access the encrypted content and one of the very interesting features in Swarm maybe is how you handle mutability. It's kind of symbolic feeds Swarm feeds and it's basically kind of some blockchain ENS if you think about it. So basically the integrity of the chunk is not by the content but actually by some sort of semantic convention let's say like okay it's my website it's like let's say this is something that you can guess you know my ENS is then hashed together with your Ethereum address that's the address now you can find it. And the mutable content actually has attestation by signature. So there's the signature which is the integrity of the chunk and this is how we handle mutable content. And this also this case for kind of quickly changing stuff like databases and things.

**[63:00] SPEAKER_00:** I mean where would you say Swarm as of 2024 sits and compares with say IPFS plus Filecoin or Arweave or others. How do they differ and what kind of uses?

**[63:15] SPEAKER_01:** You're asking me? You probably get a technical answer how it compares.

**[63:20] SPEAKER_00:** Well let's keep it light if I am a dumb end user.

**[63:25] SPEAKER_01:** No I know but what I'm saying is that it's difficult not to mention that in terms of e.g. adoption or in terms of even family.

**[63:35] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah I mean maybe in terms of adoption and just like top line features perhaps that one has and another doesn't.

**[63:45] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah so IPFS is obviously very widely used also in the Ethereum realm. It was always a very good and relatively simple architecture easy to understand I think if you compare it to Swarm. So it lacks the privacy features as well as the incentives really. I mean you can say that you can pin stuff and therefore get it preserved but those pinning services are actually quite centralized. So it's like and there's also kind of attackable in a way.

**[64:20] SPEAKER_00:** Does Filecoin work? Is that a real thing now?

**[64:25] SPEAKER_01:** Filecoin kind of does it in some way. It's mainly good for archival and you have very strong they kind of have killer feature these proof of availability proofs which actually work for proving that whatever you store there is available in various replicas which is not an obvious thing to do at all. And it's very good but mocking but this is an instant meme of someone taking a magnetic tape out and it says like someone retrieving stuff from Filecoin. Obviously if you don't have any kind of retrieval protocol or like hot retrieval layer with some sort of SLA attached to it and it's a bit difficult to have the proposition there I mean of course since then there was a lot of tries and that's changed and there's also been attempts to link it to IPFS itself the platform. So Filecoin yeah does its job. I think it's a bit of an overkill in terms of these incentives like in terms of the availability proofs and also kind of suffers a bit of the privacy issues. You have to negotiate the storage level marketplace of storage. Swarm is very different in that sense. The postage incentives it's just get rewarded for storage that belongs to your neighborhood. And pricing and the redistribution of the postage stamp revenue is kind of automatic here and there's no extra layer that you or your file or anything somewhere chunks are always distributed across many neighborhoods and whatever belongs to you node operators get rewarded for. And this redistribution game can have a nice property of central pricing basically that can be sensitive to some sort of supply signals that we can get from the game itself. It has this nice method of checking supply for demand and therefore set the price based on that thermostat type of model. I mean the question is whether it works at all and some of the assumptions might not hold a pinch of salt. But in terms of its bandwidth incentive and in terms of this postage storage incentives and also the privacy properties I would say it's quite an advanced framework. I mean apart from all the obvious goodies that we talked about like addressing and kind of URL-based addressing storage and balanced distribution and also there's a lot of symmetry we put a lot of they take it very seriously that the monetary incentive is what drives the system from bottom. So I think there's some voices in the community that don't take very seriously this kind of monetary incentives they think that maybe altruism is really not that bad and I kind of understand where they're coming from. However we take it seriously that one is an incentive like having someone behind a node client that's modeled by rational profit maximizing agent and turn this relatively low level urge of maximizing your profit into something that's generally very usable on the network level emerges as a kind of intelligent system that can serve other purposes. And this is what incentive design this is what Ethereum is amazing at expressed with the smart contracts all these kind of self-enforcing contracts how they can express beautiful incentive systems and for example it's formally taken so seriously that the strategic decisions clients can make that basically not that doesn't lead to immediate disconnect because of a syntax problem or something primitive violation this should be incentivized at least at least doing anything else than what the protocol dictates should not get a better reward. So basically you at least lose money and then this is all the way from the connectivity how you connect and how you forward stuff how you and all the strategy of what you serve what you retrieve what you cache and all this kind of stuff are properly incentivized.

**[69:00] SPEAKER_00:** So let me ask you one last big question is looking back over these 10 years have things happened as you thought they might? What you thought Ethereum was at the start has that been what it's become? Looking back on these 10 years what are your big reflections on this journey?

**[69:20] SPEAKER_01:** Interesting question. So well Ethereum is still very close to my heart in a way. But apart from the heart being aside from the sentimental approach I also think that it definitely fulfills many of its early promises and maybe some maybe some of them are kind of maturing a bit slower than I would have wanted. I mean just think of proof of stake which was supposed to come after maybe a few years it kind of happened but you know some things take a while to even develop to even conceptualize properly and yes I mean for some of these earlier ambitions of proper apps being on Swarm be like the Swarm Ethereum apps of course didn't materialize or I would say they not yet materialized because I think you have Web3 app is as Web3 as the weakest link of it. Yeah so if anything that's not decentralized in a stack like just think of the easiest examples of Tornado Cash but using Infura.

**[70:30] SPEAKER_00:** Right right.

**[70:32] SPEAKER_01:** Got forbidden to say it but you know Infura did block Tornado Cash at one point and it was obviously illegal to use in the US. But I mean so we still suffer from some of these some of these early neglects like neglecting light clients neglecting the whole proof like proofs and verification. It's a bit surprising some of these to me and it's worth kind of facing that like you know we're talking about Web3 but it's actually just we talk through a PC and then which is kind of centralized and then we talk NFTs and all this kind of stuff but I mean as Moxie in fact blog put it like he actually showed when an OpenSea the NFT that he created turns into a turd image and that. Yes so you know it's kind of I mean of course it's fun it's okay to poke fun I mean you're part of this and of course some of these things might be promise of maybe Swarm or something that we might have missed and therefore kind of lagging behind with some of these overall ecosystem promises. But I don't know my but yeah instead of lamenting on this I'm kind of I just keep on I try to share some of the positive energies into this constructive action and stuff. So in this way I'm kind of in general my approach can be described easily with a bit of solarpunk image that I'm relatively optimistic about the tech and the future of it. And I think this unstoppability is kind of unstoppable now. It's really not possible to slow it down. And I really hope that when people get it they don't necessarily look forward all this kind of stupid regulations curbing the uses of it and instead just yeah go for certain.

**[72:45] SPEAKER_00:** Okay well thanks so much and all the very best.

**[72:50] SPEAKER_01:** Okay thank you very much Bob. It was lovely to talk to you and reminisce about the past.

**[73:00] SPEAKER_00:** You too. Okay thanks so much. Bye.

**[73:05] SPEAKER_01:** Bye.
