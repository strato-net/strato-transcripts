**[SPEAKER_00:]** So hello, I am Bob Summerwill and this is Early Days of Ethereum with my good friend Viktor Trón. So hi Viktor, how are you?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Very, very well, thank you. Hello Bob. Thank you for inviting me to the show. It's wonderful to reminisce.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Well, great to have you here. So yeah, we bumped into each other in Buenos Aires for Devcon and had hoped to record there but for one reason or another that never happened. So good to connect online instead. So talking about early days of Ethereum, you were very early in Ethereum. So I mean what were you doing in your life prior to that that led you to the project.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Work wise? I was not exactly, I wouldn't say I was exactly very close to the crypto scene to be honest. I was working on a project with BBC News Labs, News Juicer project. It was trying to kind of ingest a lot of news sources like from old photo archives, video archives and everything and kind of use it like basically work through the speech recognition and everything and categorize it and make it searchable in a very nice way. I mean of course it's one of these kind of BBC sponsored projects no one really needed and it was never really used but it was a nice project to work on and anyway, so I kind of left the job.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** At that time you were in London, you were living in London?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yeah, I was in London. I was living in London and I left the job because I found Ethereum. I was very excited right away. So I guess it was when Gavin visited this kind of new web meetup some sort, I think it was a new web meetup and then presented Ethereum, I was absolutely taken aback and I found it was amazing and a game changer. And I mean what led me to it to be honest was I was already quite a bit into Bitcoin which is kind of interesting because Bitcoin came into my life through a friend who I knew from an anarchist club or like Facebook group basically. So he introduced me to it on ideological grounds but of course I was very interested in tech as well. But it took me quite a while to understand what is blockchain, how all these things come together. But by that time I was kind of solid in understanding of the blockchain and my knowledge was solid enough so that I could question Gavin and Vitalik and that it's absolutely not going to work obviously because of this halting problem. And bit by bit when I understood that they all had answers to every question that I can ever think of, then that's when I got to admit that they are probably the geniuses I really want to look up to and have in my environment to learn from. It was a very, very great start. And so when Gavin presented Ethereum I was, next day I was already hacking on the C codebase actually and my first PR in. We kind of met in a cafe in Dalston I think. And I remember I was quite impressed that Gavin used Mac but actually was running it and Linux on it. That was very impressive.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** And so you mentioned your anarchist group there. So had Bitcoin earlier been interesting to you from that kind of monetary, anarchist, libertarian perspective.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** I mean when Bitcoin came, this was the time when I even kind of learned what money was really. I mean before I didn't even grasp this notion. And it was very important times in my life. It was really a game changer to kind of have a framework in which I can totally identify myself with. Yeah, I don't know if it's the right word, but freedom-seeking individual and I really like this kind of Austrian view of economy and have understood what, how money was used and what inflation was. I never really understood before. Okay, I came late to the game, let's say. But yeah, and then it was all history after.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** And the next web meeting that you mentioned was that like a recurring meetup that you were going to or were you regularly going to kind of web meetups?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes, but this one I particularly sought out because I saw Vitalik's presentation I think in Miami and so that really got me interested. So I knew what I was in for when I showed up on that meeting in Hoxton Square. I think it was that meeting.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Sorry, you said Vitalik's presentation, was that the one that he'd given in Miami?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes, exactly. And so I knew already what to expect from it, but of course I never really understood and Gavin helped me quite a bit to understand it. So it was really great.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Had you been watching a variety of like Bitcoin conference talks? Was that a sort of regular thing that you were doing at that point? Watching.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yeah, watching YouTube? Yes, and I was very, very interested and very much into these things. I mean, I was hoping that changes related to this kind of technologies would come a lot earlier. I was already kind of sort of hyped a bit or contributed to it myself in a way.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Yeah, had you been sort of following along with things like Mastercoin and Colored Coins and other sort of Bitcoin 2.0 projects?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes, actually I did. Yeah. It was kind of, I think it was BitShares at the point.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** I'm sorry.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** And there was BitShares, I think.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** And there was this kind of, and then open transactions which was very close to kind of Gavin's heart, I think. Worked with them and yeah, I don't know what came out of that but interesting. And then so after I left the BBC and that winter which I spent in Thailand, half in a retreat and then in my spare time I was working on the yellow paper and worked my way through the really hard notation that Gavin put on paper.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Yes. A lot of people struggled with that sort of math-heavy notation and so you went to Gav's presentation which was, would have been very early February. So I mean that was only like a week or so after Vitalik's presentation in Miami. It would have been very, very close.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Correct.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** So you spoke to Gav there and then you exchanged emails, did you?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes, basically we exchanged emails. He put me on Skype group. There was a Skype group at the time, I think it was 20 odd people on it. Really not a big crowd and yeah, that's how it all started. So very nice in the beginning to have this kind of grandiose ideas and chat and be part of it. I'm super proud and very happy that I managed to be at the forefront of it. It was kind of a lucky move to be honest.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** So was it a fair bit later in that year that you started working with Danny on Swarm? Were you doing.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yeah. Then it came a little bit later. So yes, first of all, in the spring started working on the yellow paper and then a bit on the C. Not a lot. And then I think it was in March or sometime that I showed up on the first Ethereum meetup. Maybe not the first. I think you told me it was not the first but the second one in London.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** This is.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes, yes, yes, yes.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** So this was organized by Stephan Tual.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** There was Mihai there who later kind of I think. And then.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Sorry, Mihai Alisie. Was that right?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes, yes. And I think who I talked to quite a lot was Jack du Rose, who then.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Yeah, of Colony.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Colony fame. Exactly. So and then there is when I met Jeff first. So Jeff became my boss later.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** He came to London for that meetup.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes, yes, he did.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Right.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** And that's why I kind of saw that it's quite an international crowd and from all over the world kind of doing this thing. So I kind of started to take it very seriously. As I said, I kind of left my job and joined the ranks and I kind of started contributing to the Go code. And so after that I was really into Golang. That's where I contributed most and became part of the Geth team after Jeff offered me the job around. It was September, October that year when the foundation was already actively paying out some salaries or like recruiting people on the teams.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Yeah, so I mean I was looking at the timing on that. So the Ethereum Foundation was founded in July of 2014 and then the crowdsale was going through July, August, September. And then yeah, the hiring, that first wave of we've actually got some money to hire people was sort of September, October.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** In October I was negotiating it with Aeron Buchanan, I remember. He was my contact then. And then I don't know when the Amsterdam office in Weurstraat was actually founded, but I already visited Jeff, I think later in that year there. And then so when I first kind of joined, I was talking to my semi with my friends in Hungary. Some of them related to this Facebook group and among them like Dániel Nagy. And there was another person who's like very close to Swarm later but never actually entered the scene officially. Let's let him be unnamed. And so there was some thinking that maybe the four of us kind of can form a group and we can just join as a kind of sub dev team or something. But it never happened. So we were hired individually. And then so yes, around later that year, there was the Devcon zero. Is that correct?

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Yeah, yeah. I mean if we just pop back a little bit. So could you say, through 2014, prior to the sale and so on, I mean, so how were things working early in 2014? I mean, you mentioned a Skype group. Were most people kind of working through Skype?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes, yes, it was really mainly everything was done by basically by Gavin, Jeff and Vitalik. The rest of us were just sharpers on the way at that time and kind of just tapping up. I mean I'm talking about the technical stuff. I'm really not sure about the admin and the foundation stuff so hope no offense is taken from anyone but yeah for the tech stuff it's yeah. So I think it was actually in July that Jeff shared a kind of Geth to do with me and introduced me into the intricacies of the then aspiring dev p2p protocol. And so I think that was my first project. I think that was really kind of in the codebase that was then later scraped and completely rewritten by Felix and the other guys. But that was my first attempt. I think that to be a networking layer at the time I was kind of trying to say really crazy ideas to Jeff about some developer tooling some like contract verification kind of like staging and like fake blockchain environment and stuff. And he was adamant that there were other things to do and he was focusing on like maybe the end user applications like at the time was the Ethco. I think it was under Ethco but actually later the Mist browser basically right. It was a browser and so he was kind of trying to talk me out of it and said that the other group the C team is assigned to that anyway so let me not tread unwanted paths. And so he kind of brought me back to.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Yeah, well I mean he had Aleth. You had Aleth zero, right? Aleth zero I guess was an earlier kind of incarnation of that.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yeah, that's good. And then but there was some not so glorious tasks as well that I refactored logging and things like this. I remember in the early days but there was also a time when I was learning Golang because it was also not a super popular language I think a lot of learning to do and yeah.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** I mean it was relatively new at that point, Go. So you'd mentioned the yellow paper. So in those very early months of 2014 Gav in particular seemed to be like incredibly productive in terms of what he was getting through with the C client and that yellow paper back, I mean was it usually the code that was leading and then the yellow paper was being kind of modeled after that.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** It's hard for me to say if they really were that kind of hand in hand developing. I think I can't really tell. Maybe it's better to ask him to be honest but yes the productivity and the speed that he was churning out code was absolutely stunning. So it's like already a few months after some of these clients already worked. But yeah, to be honest, I mean Jeff was the same and Jeff was also incredible in his productivity. These people were really nice examples in front of us. So I was really happy to learn from them in a way. Yeah.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** And I mean I think that that triangulation was so important right of having multiple clients and the spec and you had the Python client though not really to that production status but you know those three groups all.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Who's the now glorious statement that Ethereum always was very proud of that like this multi-client development was leading to very, very solid specs. It's actually true. But of course that was not the reason. But the reason was that all these brilliant individuals just followed their own favorite language and just wanted their own clients to build. But ultimately what came out of it is amazing like the specification. I just remember just a few times that the specification had to be changed. There's like kind of one case when there's like a modular operation that was not exactly minus, I think it was minus number exactly. Not sure exactly. There was another one, I think it was around Easter 2015, whereas before in the year leading to the launch. And I think that was when it's kind of problem that the uncle had. The two uncles had the same timestamp I think and that led to a fork. I remember I wrote up a kind of blog post about this and never published it. So interesting.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Talking to Jacob Jordaens. So he was an intern at the Berlin office in 2015 but he was telling me about a hard fork that had happened on the mainnet around two weeks or so after launching, which I was completely unaware of. But then looking back, you know, there was a sort of security announcement by Jutta was a patching of the Geth client. And while I've been doing stuff myself in terms of like running old clients, I saw that as well. If you run Geth 1.0.0 or Geth 1.0.1, it gets stuck. It can't go through frontier blocks. So it was actually a hard fork.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Do you remember what it was related to? It was not that uncle one that you remembered.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** I mean it was some kind of gas counting or something, you know, just some kind of little bug. But that was funny. That was a thing that I was not aware about because I, you know, so it was a hard fork but it was never given a name because it was just an accident.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes, sure.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** And you know, you wonder how many more of these little things there were that happened that sort of forgotten in the mists of time. Yes, but yeah, so I mean through that early 2014 year you were working initially on the C and then later on the Go, I mean how many people were working on Go in 2014?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** I mean it was really just a few people around. Jeff I think was mainly designer and Alex van de Sande from Brazil and yeah, and who after him.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** But you were the second team member then, is that right?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Correct. Just about. Or maybe actually the first officially, I'm not sure. The first paid one, I'm not sure but I mean we came roughly at the same time with Alex and with, I think with Felix Lange, definitely.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Right, yeah. In terms of employment. Yeah but I meant when you were working earlier, you know, when you started there, I mean, were there other people working on that Go Ethereum ahead of your joining in with him?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Not really. Not really. So he was pretty much the one that contributed the code as far as I remember. And I mean there was quite a vibrant community of people there. Like the later became Slush, there was like Nick Savers around like super tall dude and we were going together to the Bitcoin conference, I think it was in April.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Oh, you went to Toronto?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** No, no, it was Amsterdam.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Oh, okay.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** And that's when I had the chance to really talk to Vitalik quite a bit. It was very nice and I got a bit parted as well. So nice time.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Nick Savers is a name that I've seen a lot of times and I, I've never really met or spoken to him. I guess he was around a lot early and then maybe kind of disappeared and maybe he's a little bit of an anon guy that doesn't show face.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yeah, I mean he never joined. I don't think he was ever like officially part of it, but he was always around and helping. I think he was employed by some bank.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** But I saw he and some others did the first continuous integration, you know, they were doing the build system and then he did work on the Java client as well.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** That is true. And Java client was mainly led by what was his name? Roman Mandeleil, who kind of mysteriously disappeared after. I'm not sure what happened to him.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** I did see him on Facebook for quite a time. He seems to have either disappeared or something since.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** But I remember at the London Devcon one he was definitely around there with the whole EthJ team. Yeah, I don't know what their name.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Was but Ethercamp.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** That's correct. Thanks for reminding. Well, nostalgia, all these phrases.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** So yeah, it was early, sort of early 2017 I think that he kind of disappeared. They did Hack.ether.camp and you know this some kind of like hackathon that there was some controversy about. It looked like the team kind of bought votes or something but were paid out anyway. And then yeah, he sort of disappeared with some people thinking he'd exit scammed but I'm not convinced he did because if he did it was the worst exit scam ever because it was so early, you know, like wasn't like anyone had got any kind of big amount of money or anything at that point. Sort of a very poor scam.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** He's definitely an able and also committed guy.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** So maybe. So you'd mentioned about your collaborative sub team. So that's EtherSphere.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Well, it's kind of, it was wishful thinking that it might be EtherSphere but on the other hand I did register that as an organization on GitHub at least and even I think it was pretty much one of the first Ethereum-related brands in a way. I mean if I can call it a brand. I mean I think at the time it was only Eris Industries.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Right. Yeah. Eris.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Who later became Monax, this Marmot thing and they did some nice work by the way. But yeah, so EtherSphere was the home of maybe most of our work and then we kind of committed through that to the Ethereum codebase.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** So that was yourself, Daniel Nagy.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes. And later Zsolt Felföldi like already hired to work on the light client. I think it was in 2015 already. And yeah, because he was not at Devcon 0 but yeah, Devcon 0 was already kind of. I mean it is very. So Danny and me joining by that time there was quite a bit of path around with him I think.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** So maybe could you say a bit about Swarm? Because my understanding is that some of the ideas went an awful long way back.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yeah. So I don't know if you remember there was in May 2014 there was a seminal triad of talks in I think it was in Whitechapel somewhere. And in that talk that was the first appearance of Web3 in the Ethereum context. It was always usually explained. These founders really realized how decentralization can basically also be extended and logical to support the entire, be the backend of the entire web. And basically if you extend it to data, app data and then hosting and so basically put a data layer on top and then maybe the messaging, then you can conceive of it as the world computer with this holy trinity of, you can see them like the Ethereum blockchain as the world computer's CPU and disk would be Swarm and then Whisper would be the kind of messaging layer.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** So you were mentioning Whitechapel. So that was again some meetups was it? That was happening there.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** And I think maybe Ethereum even had some sort of coworking or like some sort of hideout office there, maybe a room or two because we often found Vitalik there. So not entirely sure how this looked like. I don't want to say anything but yeah.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Would that have been when that kind of famous diagram would first have surfaced? You know the one with like the circle and the apps coming in at the side.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes, that was just about.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** That time including QML I saw. So it was not just HTML, it was QML and Qt as other anticipated tech platforms.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes, that's when Web3 was born. And it's kind of the crazy protocol names like after these which is a which is also the lettering in Icelandic.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Oh yeah, the thorn.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes. And so that's when bzz and shh was invented. Also Vitalik's gimmicks.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Those Ethereum. Well, the subprotocols. Right, subprotocols running on a common basis. But that Ethereum was just one of many related protocols.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** And that's why I was very dedicated to this whole Ethereum at the time. I really kind of understood what it means to have the entire kind of Turing-complete computation being secured on its own with the blockchain. And I kind of really envisioned quite a bit of change in how the internet works if you have Swarm and Whisper and all these things. So I quite liked the idea. And then later I kind of learned that not only did we socialize on BitTorrent at the time and kind of wanted to improve it, but actually some of us like Danny operating a DC node had some legal troubles maybe, maybe even also kind of talk about this with him at some point. So that's kind of brought him quite directly in the kind of realm of implementing Swarm. This idea of a decentralized storage and incentivization, etc. And name resolution when let me see you connected.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** And Zsolt had mentioned to me that he thought that the idea for Swarm had gone back to at least 2011.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yeah, so yeah, there was this idea, of course I don't know about that, but it was mainly Danny's idea that he saw the amazing qualities of BitTorrent, but he also saw some drawbacks. So maybe historically it's best to derive the whole idea of Swarm from them. Because BitTorrent had difficulty like starting a download, there's all this kind of noise and throttling rules. And of course didn't have the proper incentives to keep the data. And also of course had the problem with the individual bits of the file not being addressable right away. You had to use a tracker to resolve them. And of course that there's also a problem with the previous interviews in Parallels. Because I mean, as you remember, for example in Germany there was legal prosecution for people who used BitTorrent.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Oh, I didn't know that.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** And I mean not at the time, but much later, but yeah. So I think what Danny was trying to do is like came up with an idea of how to chunk things in a way every chunk is kind of content addressable and also kind of that some of the placement of chunks is also part of the DHT. So normally a DHT like a distributed hash table is basically the idea that you put node IDs and then kind of chunk IDs of content basically in the same space and somehow you get information what's the location, like who to download it from about these chunks from neighborhoods that have the same address or similar address. So there's usually a metric on this. If you use the xor metric like that, then you can work with Kademlia and it's Kademlia networks. You kind of iterate through the peers like you keep a few peers connected and you go. So then you go closer one to this guy, to this guy and the hash of Star Wars and you want to watch Star Wars and then you hop and ultimately you see where the chunks are we can download from. Obviously this is not very private. And then and also kind of it's not very as you know from the from this kind of legal problems that it's also not very deniable. And if you have enforced certain chunks should reside so you kind of enforce a kind of orange layer on top of it, then you can probably deny that you know anything about it system that enforces that parts of parts of the Star Wars story. Basically it was Danny's genius idea that I think we call it the DPA. He sent us to preimage jacket. So basically an archive of preimages. Preimages there's a bit of data that the image of is the hash yet the preimage is what's before the hashing the actual piece of the data. And so this idea of actually storing not the location but the actual data at the place in the DHT has direct DHT interpretation was the DPA. And that was kind of a very important notion that came and then became very important in this Swarm. And then yeah, and then a lot of other things came. So I remember that we were in 2015 or fourth quarter and that winter day we were sitting in the Arena Plaza in Budapest the three of us with Zsolt talking about this and how to start implementing because there was a pressure to obviously implement the whole thing with using UDP as the networking stack because it was considered that like TCP is too heavy and too slow. But then obviously that at the time you already had the devp2p it's very very easy to implement it and then try this protocol. So I suggested that maybe instead of using UDP just use TCP but use it forwarding keep alive some connections basically permanent connections with the peers and just use the Kademlia with the through the live connections that each forwarding like reach locally decided to forward to the closer node and ultimately move backward. Like you forward the request and you backward the chunk after all. And so it was, it seemed like very easy to implement. And we did exactly that. Turned out to be one of the best and most interesting choices of Swarm. It turns out that that's what allows the kind of peer-to-peer accounting to be working. And also this kind of gives the privacy features that this Swarm has basically obfuscates the originator of the request. If you think about it, no one knows that. And when someone down there is asking you something and they want to watch the Star Wars or someone upstream wants to watch and also kind of it directly solved the opportunistic caching problem, how to distribute automatically popular content. So with the retrieval paths or the forwarding paths can just remember some of the chunks. So it's very, very interesting how these ideas started and then basically kind of coalesced in 2016 Swarm I think, I think the first, the very first release of Swarm in Geth 1.5 or so it was a, it was December 2016. Yes. For public alpha was released and I remember there was already kind of how we viewed video. We call it streaming, but it's actually not real-time streaming. It's like just watch the video file. There was a nice tweet about that too.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** And just to take a step back, so I mean my understanding of a primary thought that there was with Swarm was that because you could have this, you know, the holy trinity right of sort of like decentralized compute database the blockchain Swarm for the decentralized file system and storage and then Whisper for that decentralized messaging that you could have this really nice kind of synergy of say a primary issue which is still really not solved of saying well how do you host the web frontend to make a whole application? Yes you need your smart contracts and your transactions and things but you need an application wrapping around that. So really the thought that if you had a decentralized storage mechanism that could store like the HTML and the JavaScript and so on that you want like an incentive system so that that stuff is available if people want it. You know that you don't have a tragedy of the commons where only most popular content is available. But also because if you are building on Ethereum you've got the cryptocurrency to do the incentives you've got the smart contract system that allows you to implement those incentive systems and all of these things can fit together into a holistic unstoppable whole of saying well here you go you've got your applications which cannot be stopped but that's the full stack. And it seems even now that there's an awful lot of stuff which is dependent on centralized hosted services and it's very central.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sad about this to be honest. I mean there's a lot of these things like I don't know if you remember this big, I don't know, was it BitBase? That was the biggest crypto heist ever because of the, because of the Safe hack. If that had been using Swarm then it was much more difficult to change all these kind of transactions under the hood because they had to, what they had to do is like they hacked the person, had the dev's account and then uploaded something through S3 which then the Safe wallet used. And of course these are much more difficult to do if these things are content addressed of course registered. This is how these things work. Like you start from the blockchain which is that single source of truth like ENS or services as a name, you resolve it to content hash and then the content hash is retrieved from these decentralized stores.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** And I mean again that 2016 kind of era was when ENS was coming to life as well. So yeah, I mean that's another thing actually.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Nick Johnson was first part of the Swarm team, as part of the Swarm team. He developed the ENS and then later took off.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** I didn't know he worked on Swarm. I knew he was part of the Geth team. But he did some Swarm as well, eh?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Well, definitely, yeah, I recruited him to be honest.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Fantastic. Did you know him in London?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** No, no, no. I mean he was just part of the community. Valuable contributions to the after that.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Yeah, let me just check the timeline. But I think he got hired like really pretty soon after me. I started in February 2016 and I think he was maybe June, same kind of time as Hudson. Yeah, let's see. So yeah, I started in February, Greg Colvin in March, Everton Fraga in April.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yeah.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** And yeah, June. Both Hudson and Jamie Pitts and Nick Johnson all June 2016. What was I going to mention? So yeah, you talked about Devcon 0. So that was November 2014 in Berlin, I imagine. Was that the first time that you would have met quite a number of these people.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Especially special memory is my meeting with Alex Leverington. Oh yes, the devp2p fame. Yeah, very interesting. We had lots of discussions. Yeah, very adamant on, very stubborn with his own way of thinking about the protocol. I have to say he was much more knowledgeable than I was at the time. So I was just trying to learn a lot from him. But at the same time I was trying to be a bit more pragmatic and trying to simplify. I remember I first basically brought together the kind of specs for the for that protocol then and then that was not really followed just right. Yeah, yeah.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Well, I mean the other, the other piece there is that libp2p as part of the Protocol Labs IPFS that already existed at that time. So that was kind of interesting, right? This whole devp2p libp2p.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** I mean, you know how Ethereum kind of suffered this kind of not invented here syndrome.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Not invented here syndrome.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Thank you. And like the RLP stuff.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Right.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Then we have their own serialization protocol like the devp2p as well. I have to say that devp2p at some point was kind of a lean party protocol.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Right, excellent.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** For the purposes of including into this Swarm, it's a it has a lot less bloat. But of course it had a lot of problems in terms of maintenance. I mean it was just not appropriate to start like certain and build everything from scratch. In a way it's like in retrospect it was probably not the best idea to be honest.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** And I mean that's got then that's got stuck in the execution clients forever. You know that the consensus clients now are using libp2p and aren't using RLP anymore, but the execution client got stuck with devp2p forever. And I mean I remember having discussions with various people on this in sort of 2016 of saying well could you have both protocols, you know, people looking at sort of could you do a bridge protocol so that some of the stuff could run over libp2p and you could have like relay nodes really with the thought that with libp2p you could run in a browser. Right. You know, devp2p you could never run in a browser. And so like Kumavis was working with somebody from the Parity team, maybe Robert Habermeier or maybe a little later, 2017, 2018 of trying to see well can we get a light client in browser talking to all of these things but never quite happened. Some of these decisions just last forever.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** It was only after we after the Swarm left the foundation is when we kind of switched to libp2p as well, started a Bee client development.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Right, right. I was yeah, I wasn't aware that that transition had happened. So I mean Devcon 0. So that was late 2014. But things continued obviously through 2015 all the way up.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Swarm was just an idea which was kind of mainly kind of was meant to be spec'd out or kind of started by Danny who had this kind of very interesting past with decentralized storage and he actually presented his vision of that at Devcon 0 yeah everyone watch it very good early capturing of this idea after that.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** And at that point he got hired in and that became a real thread of official development within the Ethereum stack.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Absolutely correct. And then later then as time went by gathered around him and continued on churning out some code around who? Sorry, yeah, about Danny. And then kind of slowly organically became a little bit of a subteam after that and yeah, and so after that like never really contributed the first bit which he which was even I think he was even programmed on before Ethereum.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Came as you said he was telling me that you know he was thinking that was what he would be doing when he was hired in but then almost immediately Jeff told him yeah no you're not, you're just doing you're just working on Geth.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes, yes. I mean Danny signed for to develop the incentivized file sharing protocol he worked on for many many years and it's a bit sad that it never took off to be honest but there's been a lot of things.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Yeah, well I mean it's tough. I mean that's my interest in that is where my own journey started because when I kind of got interested in Ethereum the first thing I wanted to do was I was really into mobile and wearables at that time so I wanted to see can I run an Ethereum node on my smartwatch? So I was doing ARM Linux cross builds of cpp-ethereum and my thought at that time was okay you know light client is still getting worked out but I'll get a full client working on all these devices and then when light client comes out they'll just work right? So I can run a full client on a testnet make sure it all works. But it's just a matter of time. Of course we'll have light clients and of course everything will scale and of course you can run all things on any devices right? We're thinking every phone is you're just going to have an Ethereum node running every router media box.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** We're still suffering the kind of RPC and centralized access right? How unstoppable is that?

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Yeah, it will just get you know you it will just come with every Linux distro you know it'll just be like a service that's just part of the Linux distro you know just get shipped. You've just got this background service that you know that is just talking Ethereum and it'd be the same as like having a network stack or an audio stack or whatever. It's just like yeah you're going to have a consensus stack and it'll just run in the background and just work cheap and easy. Yeah, not. No that didn't quite happen.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** And then 10 years in it's kind of maybe things are starting like I don't know if you know the EthBoot project for example.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** No. What's that?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** How to boot from Swarm basically. Yeah.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Booting from Swarm.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes. I mean they just building this kind of UEFI client that's can bring up a kind of any operating system.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Wow. Okay. That's interesting.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes interesting. I mean it's not worked out fully yet but the guys.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** I mean there's a fair bit of like networking stuff that would have to happen before you could even start right. Like that's having to have some kind of bootstrapping little mini OS or something.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** It seems that even before that you can you can do it just. Yeah I mean they already have that kind of pattern. Kind of a small Linux init environment is created and they boot from that. That's interesting. And they can do it just with the network.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** So I mean through those early years prior to mainnet launch you'd mentioned work on the yellow paper so I mean how was it being determined what you know what feature complete what good enough looks like you know have you got a good idea of what what you'd have to have before launch could happen?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** I mean well I didn't have a clear idea really because it took me a while to understand the systems. To be very honest with you it's like I think it's only Jeff who really overstood what was needed to be built and he was building massive things on his own single-handedly. It's really crazy. I remember when it was one of the not so willing tasks that I was assigned the task of building the block pool which was supposed to be like the one that takes the blocks from the other clients builds up the header chain and kind of validates it etc. And I was working a lot on that and I remember time and he had enough and said okay I just build it and basically one or two days and it was done. Interesting experience.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** And Christian Jentzsch was building the cross-client tests as well. Did you do work with those tests yourselves? You sorry.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** I mean no I did myself but yeah I remember it was always he was always running and he found a lot of things through that.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** So in July 2015 we had the arrival of Ming Chan and shortly afterwards you know pretty serious budget cuts because within that year or so the foundation had managed to pretty much burn through the vast majority of the money.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Austerities I think was the official name of that. Yeah I remember at the time when Vitalik basically said that Swarm is not going to be Swarm. What's going to be is maybe we just kind of use IPFS and let's try to work on the incentive system that we can put on that.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Okay.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** And I mean I remember that maybe it's not a secret anymore but Jeff let us keep working on Swarm throughout this period so we did and very soon after kind of those we basically ready incentivization scheme for the bandwidth incentives. It's also very interesting because Swarm seems to be one of the only one of the only systems like decentralized storage systems that has a proper bandwidth incentive in a proper accounting system like this swap for that accounting and it seems like it's quite I don't know I don't know it's probably conjectured but it doesn't look like there's any other proper way to do this because if you think about bandwidth first of all it's a kind of instant gratification thing. You either forward for someone like you either serve a request or not. So it's not like the storage territory affair like a future promise like storage you have to then record your deal on the chain and like some proof of availability etc. But bandwidth is just much more much more kind of yeah seems like easier solved by just peer-to-peer accounting that you know I forward for you you forward for me and which is really for each other and it is a bit tilt then some sort of conversation should happen but naturally maybe not even has to be some settlement around just. And then we kind of like this idea that's also kind of that is genius that came up in this kind of checkbook idea. It's very early version of offchain sort of payment channel like micropayment solution and yeah so that bandwidth incentive was a very powerful one lived on long and I remember that kind of seemed that the incentivization for storage was much more difficult the way to arrive at there was the negative incentives to solve the problem of sort of pricing and the growth and who's responsible for what and if everything is recorded on chain how to the privacy of things. It's very very difficult. So it came much much much later and kind of worked out. Look at that part as well. It was only after even the token the Swarm token was released 2021. Yeah. Anyway so yeah going back to the roots the austerities.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** So you were continuing to work through late 2015 even though it had supposedly been defunded?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yeah yeah kind of yes. I mean we were trying to figure out this incentive of course like and in that sense we were of course not really off track in a way but and I was also kind of working at the time on the Geth client on many aspects of it. And by 2017 the kind of Swarm client was kind of integrated and was released within Geth. It was in 2018 when this kind of the concept release was part of the G. And it's kind of when the so when the Swarm client was starting you start the standalone Swarm.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Starting 2018 you said.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yeah proof of concept three.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** So all the way through until that point you were continuing to work as a sort of Geth team member.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes. I mean officially we were part of the yes the Geth team it's part of the Ethereum entity and kind of yeah slowly extending the team as the protocol got some movement. So yeah it was interesting times because I remember in 2016 when after Nick Johnson left he hired some other people on the protocol and then yeah that's what kind of I emerged as the team lead at the time kind of organically trying to pull together the threads and.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** So with the Swarm Foundation how and when did that happen and how did you come to you know kind of leave the Geth team I guess.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Well since 2018 autumn actually 2018 summer and a person called Albert Ni like started to offer help for Swarm. They were kind of asking what we need. They seemed very helpful.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** And that's Albert Ni is this.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes I think so yeah.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Who had basically joined the Ethereum Foundation at the same time as Aya.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yeah yeah I am very very very. I mean you know to be honest I'm on very good terms with Ming and before so. But when Albert came he seemed very helpful and tried to solve some staffing problems and things. But then negotiations started and after that it seems that by Prague we kind of got into some serious discussions and then and after that we kind of I think it was right at the last day of the Prague Devcon was submitting the proposal for funding and that was very interesting because I never really got any serious feedback on that and always a bit wondered like what could have happened. And then there was some issues went on with Shawn O'Connor as the point of contact delegated by Aya.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Who.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Sorry Shawn O'Connor.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Right.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes. There was the delegated point of contact for for us the Swarm team. And then slowly slowly like after that I think I think the kind of the EF scores changed a bit and that's when every team needed to submit a kind of proposal and things that's a kind of this whole scheme started of like trying to graduate some of the some of the teams and some of the protocols out of the foundation yeah have them get individual funding and bridge the gap with some grants. And then that's what happened with Swarm as well. So I remember 2019 there was a Swarm summit in Madrid which was very very successful. A lot of partnerships like subscribed to some some monetary help as well. But then and then the foundation also kind of.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Prompted.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** To back it up and then and somehow that never happened. So we kind of resorted to launching our own token which we did in 2021 and some kind of it's already with one year into the new Swarm client like the Bee client and and yes. So when we launched token we started a new with some new life breathed into the whole thing. And that's when we started working seriously about implementing the postage storage incentives and the rest of the features just came.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** I mean was that the same sort of time as your codebase became independent? Like did that kind of coincide that you're like right we're an independent thing we're going to make a new client we're going to switch to libp2p and it's you know it's not going to be integrated in directly with Geth. Were those happening at the same time or did the tech happen earlier?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes not really. I think the Swarm codebase was taken out of the Geth quite a lot before. So I think maybe 2019. I'm not even sure when but I think it was POC 4 I think. And when it was taken out I think it was am too expensive I guess or something. Anyway it's not really good idea to mix the two. We were able to connect it's very very separate and kind of separate development scheme agenda and I guess.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Maybe Nick Johnson's sort of experience with spinning out ENS and the ENS foundation that would that would have preceded yours. So perhaps you were looking to that as a as a pattern. Sorry we're getting some really bad audio. Can you maybe move a little closer?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes. Can you hear me now?

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Yeah that's better.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yeah yeah it's very inspiring. And we did get some so we did get a grant from the from the foundation and also kind of bridging bridging grant. And then and as I said like later somehow somehow it never materialized with that kind of program that had budget put together with the team. But ultimately we made it. And then we had our own foundation in Switzerland which started the Swarm association and then which kind of issued the token. And yeah that a new era of development.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** One thing we skipped over maybe we can just quickly go back to is Devcon 1. So that was in London in November 2015. So I assume you were there. Do you have what are your memories of that event?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** I just recently rewatched it and I remember I was very pretty much kind of very sick already. I don't know if you know but I had I was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2009, 15 years ago. And when I did Devcon 1 I was not very you it's not very easy to follow. And here I was a bit surprised. I didn't remember at the time that was so such a so difficult in terms of my movement. But sorry sorry for that for maybe unsolicited diversion. But yes as for the content I remember that we had a very very yeah successful presentation of Swarm. There was a lot of interest at the time.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** I mean I was looking back at you're saying you're looking back I was looking back at some Devcon 1 videos recently.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** And like I guess my my takeaway looking back is so many ideas were presented you know by that point nearly anything that you can think of in all the different areas it seemed that somebody was working on that you know you'd got this real flourishing of people building on Ethereum by that point you know like anything you could imagine seemingly was presented there.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** I remember and I was already seeing we always thought that okay from next year we're gonna have like all these wonderful decentralized services like decentralized delivery or like justito whatever you call it like decentralized eBay decentralized Uber and Airbnb and all kind of things and of course and then you know of course they all need their kind of Swarm like thing or data distribution or some sort of scalable scalable data layer behind it that came much much later.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Yeah many of them like five or ten years too early.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yes. And yeah so this is definitely what happened to Swarm like it did not realize much much later in now at least it's working so so.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** So yeah can you talk a little bit about where Swarm is now? What's happening? How's the functionality?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yeah so we have quite solid network and kind of consolidated the fair narrow definition of the of the protocol. So basically it's kind of DPA or like the distributed chunk store definition where nodes communicate basically and then they distribute the chunks. It's kind of a storage model as well as content distribution network and has rather rather strong privacy properties which are quite unique. And I mean really it's kind of where the analogy is I don't know you make the checkbook and postage stamp. Postage stamp is something that you attach to a chunk piece of data to keep it alive and that's kind of a hot wallet anyway that's kind of when you put some money on it some storage rent gets deducted and until it runs out of funds you know your content is live is available hot and yeah so I mean on the way we very early when we implemented kind of this manifest idea the manifest basically just like mapping of strings to documents which you can use as a key value storage from a sitemap but also kind of a directory tree right. So basically you can that way implement directories and files and so that was the first extension and we're already talking about erasure codes and stuff in 2016 and got only implemented maybe two or three years ago and and it's kind of a very interesting concept of how we can invert it in the erasure codes. But yeah so there's also this kind of thing called ACT which is like the access control mechanism access control mechanism that allows you to kind of manage the grantees that can access the encrypted file or directory. So basically have a way to kind of get to the encryption decryption key encrypted content and one of the very interesting stuff in Swarm maybe one of the very interesting features is how you handle mutability. It's kind of single owner feeds Swarm feeds and it's basically kind of some sub block ENS if you think about it. So basically the integrity of the chunk is not it's not by the content but actually by some sort of semantic convention let's say like okay it's my my website it's like let's see this is something that you can guess you know my CV is then hashed together with your Ethereum address that's the address now you can find it. And the mutable content is actually has integrity by signature. So there's the signature which is the integrity of the chunk and it's this how we handle mutable content. And this also this case for kind of quickly quickly changing stuff like databases and things.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** I mean where would you say Swarm as of 2024 sits and compares with you know say IPFS plus Filecoin or Arweave or others. How do they differ and you know what kind of uses?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** You're asking me? You probably got a technical answer how it compares.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Well let's keep it light if I am a dumb end user.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** No I know but what I'm saying is that it's difficult not to not to of course not to mention that in terms of e.g. adoption or in terms of even even family.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Yeah I mean maybe in terms of adoption and just like top line features perhaps that one has and another doesn't.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Yeah so IPFS is obviously very very widely used also kind of in the Ethereum realm. It was always a very very good and relatively simple simple architecture easy to understand I think if you compare it to Swarm. So it lacks the privacy features as well as the incentives really. I mean you can say that you can pin stuff and therefore get it preserved but those pinning services are actually quite centralized. So it's like and there's also kind of attackable in a way.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Does Filecoin work? Is that a real thing now?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Filecoin kind of does it in some way. It's mainly mainly good for archival and you have very strong they kind of have killer feature these proof of availability proofs which actually work for proving that whatever you store there is available in various replicas which is not an obvious thing to do at all. And it's very good but mocking but this is an instant meme of someone taking a magnetic tape out and it says like someone retrieving stuff from Filecoin. Obviously if you don't have any kind of retrieval retrieval protocol or like hot retrieval layer with some sort of SLA attached to it and it's a bit difficult to have the proposition there I mean of course since then there was a lot of tries and then since then that's changed and there's also kind of there's been also attempts to link it to IPFS itself the platform. So so Filecoin kind of yeah does its job. I think it's a bit of an overkill in terms of these incentives of like in terms of the availability proofs and also kind of suffer some bit of the privacy issues. You have to negotiate the storage level marketplace of storage. Swarm is very very different in that sense. The postage incentives it's just get rewarded for storage that belong to your neighborhood. And pricing and the redistribution of the kind of postage stamp revenue as we call it's kind of automatic here and there's no extra layers that you or your file or anything somewhere chunks are always distributed across many neighborhoods and whatever belongs to you node operators get rewarded for. And this redistribution game can have a nice property of a central pricing basically that can be that sensitive to some sort of supply signals that we can get from the game itself. It has this nice method of checking supply for demand and therefore set the price based on that thermostat type of model. I mean the question is whether it works at all and some of the assumptions might not hold a pinch of salt. But in terms of its bandwidth incentive and in terms of this postage storage incentives and also the privacy properties I would say it's quite an advanced framework. I mean from apart from all the obvious goodies that we talked about like addressing and kind of URL based addressing storage and balanced distribution and also there's a lot of emphasis we put a lot of they take it very seriously that the monetary incentives is what drives the system from bottom. So I think there's some voices in the community that don't take very seriously this kind of monetary incentives they think that maybe altruism is really not that bad and I kind of understand where they're coming from. However we take it seriously that once an incentive like having someone behind a node client that's kind of modeled by rational profit maximizing agent and turn this kind of relatively low level urge of maximizing your profit into something that's generally very very usable on the network level emerges as a kind of intelligent system that can serve other purposes. And this is what incentive design this is what Ethereum is amazing at expressed with the smart contracts all these kind of self-enforcing contracts how they can express these beautiful incentive systems and for example it's formally taken so seriously that the organizational strategic decision is that clients can make that basically not that doesn't lead to kind of immediate disconnect because of a syntax problem or like something protocol violation. This should be incentivized at least at least doing anything else than what the protocol dictates should should not get a better better reward. So basically you at least you lose money and then this is all the way from from the connectivity how how you connect and how you forward stuff how you and all the strategy of what you what you kind of that you serve what you what you retrieve what you cache and all this kind of stuff are properly properly incentivized.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** So let me ask you one last big question is looking back over these 10 years have things happened as you thought they might? What you thought Ethereum was at the start has that been what it's become? You know what looking back on these 10 years what are your big reflections on this journey?

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Interesting question. So well Ethereum is still very very close to my heart in a way. But apart from the heart being aside from the sentimental approach I also think that it definitely fulfills many of its early promises and maybe some maybe some of them are kind of maturing a bit slower than I would have wanted. I mean just think of the proof of stake which was supposed to come after maybe a few years it kind of happened but you know some things take a while to even develop to even conceptualize properly and yes I mean for some of these earlier ambitions of of proper apps being on Swarm sorry sorry be like the Swarm Ethereum apps of course didn't materialize or I would say I would say that they not considered as best property materialized because I think you have Web3 app is as Web3 as the weakest link of it yeah. So if anything that's not so decentralized in a stack like just think of the easiest examples of Tornado Cash but using Infura.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Right right.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** God forbid for me to say it but you know Infura did block Tornado Cash at one point and it was obviously illegal to use in the.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** US.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** And but I mean so we still suffer from some of these some of these early neglects like neglecting light clients neglecting the whole proof like proofs and verification. It's a bit surprising some of these to me and it's worth kind of facing that like you know we're talking about Web3 but it's actually just we talk through RPC and then which is kind of centralized and then we talk NFTs and all this kind of stuff but I mean as Moxie in his blog put it like he actually showed when an OpenSea the NFT that he created turns into a turd image and that yes. So you know it's kind of I mean of course it's fun it's okay to poke fun I mean you're part of this and of course of course you know some of these things might be might be a promise promise of maybe Swarm or something that we might have missed and therefore kind of lagging behind with some of these overall ecosystem promises. But I don't know I've been my but yeah instead of lamenting on this I'm kind of I just keep on there I try to share some of the positive energies into this constructive action and stuff. So in this way I'm kind of in general my approach can be described easily with a bit of solarpunk image that I'm relatively optimistic about the tech and the future of it. And I think this unstoppability is kind of unstoppable now. It's really not possible to slow it down. And I really hope that when people get it they don't necessarily look forward all this kind of stupid regulations curbing curbing the uses of it and instead just yeah go for it.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** Okay well thanks so much and all the very best.

**[SPEAKER_01:]** Okay thank you very much Bob. It was lovely to talk to you and reminisce about the past.

**[SPEAKER_00:]** You too. Okay thanks so much. Bye. Bye.
