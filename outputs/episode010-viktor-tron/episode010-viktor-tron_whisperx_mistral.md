**[00:00] SPEAKER_01:** So, hello. I am Bob Summerwill, and this is Early Days of Ethereum with my good friend Viktor Trón. Hi, Viktor. How are you?

**[00:06] SPEAKER_00:** Very, very well. Thank you. Hello, Bob. Thank you for inviting me to the show. It's wonderful.

**[00:11] SPEAKER_01:** Well, great to have you here. So, talking about the early days of Ethereum, you were very early in Ethereum. What were you doing in your life prior to that that led you to the project, and then work-wise?

**[00:22] SPEAKER_00:** Not exactly. I wouldn't say I was exactly very close to the crypto scene, to be honest. I was working on a project with the BBC News Labs, basically a news juicer project. It was trying to ingest a lot of news sources like old photo archives, video archives, everything, and work through speech recognition and categorize it. We made it searchable in a very nice way. It was one of those BBC-sponsored projects that no one really needed. It was never really used, but it was a nice project to work on. I left the job because I found Ethereum. I was very excited right away. When Gavin Wood visited this kind of web, new web meetup, and presented Ethereum, I was absolutely taken aback and thought it was amazing and a game-changer.

**[01:16] SPEAKER_01:** You were in London? You were living in London?

**[01:18] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, I was in London. I was living in London, and I left the job because I found Ethereum. I was very excited right away. I mean, what led me to it was already being quite into Bitcoin, which is kind of interesting because Bitcoin came into my life through a friend who I knew from an anarchist club or anarchist Facebook group. He introduced me to it on ideological grounds. I was very interested in tech as well, but it took me a while to understand what blockchain was and how all these things came together. By that time, my understanding was solid enough to question Gavin and Vitalik. I realized they had answers to every question I could think of, and that's when I got convinced that they were geniuses I could look up to. It was a very great start. The next day, I was already hacking on the C++ codebase and had my first PR in. We met in a cafe in Dalston. It was impressive that I learned how to use Mac, but it was running Linux OS.

**[02:32] SPEAKER_01:** You mentioned your anarchist group. Had Bitcoin earlier been interesting to you from that kind of monetary, anarchist, libertarian perspective?

**[02:41] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, I have to say yes. Bitcoin was when I learned what money was. I never grasped this notion before. It was important to have a framework to identify myself with. I really like the Austrian view of the economy and understood how our money was used and what inflation was. I came late to the game, but it was all very interesting.

**[03:07] SPEAKER_01:** The next web meeting that you mentioned, was that a recurring meetup that you were going to, or were you regularly going to web meetups?

**[03:15] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, but this one was particularly interesting because I saw Vitalik's presentation in Miami. I knew what to expect, but I never really understood. Gavin helped me understand it.

**[03:32] SPEAKER_01:** You said Vitalik's presentation was in Miami?

**[03:34] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, exactly, the Miami conference. There was a meetup in Hoxton Square. I knew what to expect, but Gavin helped me understand it.

**[03:47] SPEAKER_01:** Were you watching a variety of Bitcoin conference talks? Was that a regular thing you were doing at that point, watching YouTube?

**[03:54] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, I was very interested and very much into these things. I was hoping changes related to this kind of technology would come earlier. I was already cautious and sold on the hype.

**[04:09] SPEAKER_01:** Had you been following things like MasterCoin and Colored Coins and other Bitcoin 2.0 projects?

**[04:16] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, I did. There was this kind of chairs idea, and then Open Transactions, which was close to Gavin's heart. I don't know what came after that, but it was interesting. After I left the BBC, I spent winter in Thailand in retreat and worked on the yellow paper in my spare time.

**[04:41] SPEAKER_01:** You spoke to Gavin there, and then you exchanged emails?

**[04:45] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, we exchanged emails. He put me on a Skype group with about 20 people. It was a vibrant ecosystem of people making the data become slow. There was Nick Szabo, a very tall dude, and we went to the Bitcoin conference in Amsterdam. I talked to Vitalik quite a bit, and it was a nice time.

**[05:19] SPEAKER_01:** Nick Szabo is a name I've seen a lot. I never really met or spoke to him. He was always around early and then maybe disappeared.

**[05:28] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, he was never an official Ethereum team member but always helping. He was employed by some bank. He did the first continuous integration with some others on the Java client. He was mainly Roman Mandalay, who mysteriously disappeared after a few years. I still talked to him at the London Devcon. It was Defcon One, around there with the Ethereum J team. They did Hacker Gold, which was an early 2017 hackathon with some controversy about buying votes. It looked like an exit scam, but it wasn't a good one if it was.

**[06:17] SPEAKER_01:** You mentioned working on the yellow paper. Through 2014, you were working initially on the C++ and then later on the Go. How many people were working on Go in 2014?

**[06:30] SPEAKER_00:** Not many. Jeff was the main designer, and Alex van de Sande was around. I was among the first officially paid ones. I think Felix was around the same time.

**[06:46] SPEAKER_01:** When you started there, were there other people working on Go Ethereum ahead of your joining?

**[06:52] SPEAKER_00:** Not really. I was pretty much among the ones that contributed to the core. There was a vibrant community of people like Nick Szabo and a very tall little dude. We went to the Bitcoin conference in April in Amsterdam.

**[07:11] SPEAKER_01:** You went to Toronto?

**[07:13] SPEAKER_00:** No, Amsterdam. It was a nice party month. Nick Szabo was never an official Ethereum team member but always helping. He was employed by some bank.

**[07:30] SPEAKER_01:** He did work on the Java client as well.

**[07:32] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, he did the first continuous integration with some others on the Java client. It was mainly Roman Mandalay, who mysteriously disappeared after a few years. I still talked to him at the London Devcon. It was Defcon One, around there with the Ethereum J team. They did Hacker Gold, which was an early 2017 hackathon with some controversy about buying votes. It looked like an exit scam, but it wasn't a good one if it was.

**[08:02] SPEAKER_01:** The Ethereum Foundation was founded in July 2014, and the crowd sale was going through July, August, September. The hiring wave started in September, October.

**[08:14] SPEAKER_00:** In October, I was negotiating with Aaron Buchanan. I don't know when the Amsterdam office was funded, but I visited Jeff later that year. I talked to my friends in Hungary about forming a sub-team, but we were hired individually.

**[08:36] SPEAKER_01:** Through 2014, how were things working early in 2014? Were most people working through Skype?

**[08:43] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, everything was done through Skype. Gavin, Jeff, and the rest of us were Sherpas. I think it was July that Jeff shared a kind of devp2p theme with me and introduced me to the aspiring devp2p protocol. My first project was in the codebase, which was later scraped and rewritten. I tried to talk about developer tooling and contract verification, but Jeff talked me out of it. I had Alice Zero and some not-so-glorious tasks like fact logging. I was learning Go because it wasn't a popular language.

**[09:35] SPEAKER_01:** Gavin seemed incredibly productive with the C++ client and the yellow paper. Was the code leading and the yellow paper modeled after that?

**[09:45] SPEAKER_00:** It's hard to say. They were hand-in-hand developing. Gavin and Jeff were incredible in their productivity. The specification had to be changed a few times, like the modular operation and the anchor with the same timestamp.

**[10:09] SPEAKER_01:** There was a hard fork around two weeks after launch that I wasn't aware of. It was a patching of the client and a security announcement by Vitalik. It was a gas counting issue, a little bug. It was a hard fork but never given a name because it was an accident.

**[10:33] SPEAKER_00:** Do you remember what it was related to?

**[10:36] SPEAKER_01:** It was some kind of gas counting or something. Jakub Czepluk, an intern at the Berlin office in 2015, mentioned it. It was a hard fork but never given a name because it was an accident.

**[10:53] SPEAKER_00:** I don't remember exactly.

**[10:56] SPEAKER_01:** Through that early 2014 year, you were working initially on the C++ and then later on the Go. How many people were working on Go in 2014?

**[11:07] SPEAKER_00:** Not many. Jeff was the main designer, and Alex van de Sande was around. I was among the first officially paid ones. I think Felix was around the same time.

**[11:21] SPEAKER_01:** When you started there, were there other people working on Go Ethereum ahead of your joining?

**[11:26] SPEAKER_00:** Not really. I was pretty much among the ones that contributed to the core. There was a vibrant community of people like Nick Szabo and a very tall little dude. We went to the Bitcoin conference in April in Amsterdam.

**[11:45] SPEAKER_01:** You went to Toronto?

**[11:47] SPEAKER_00:** No, Amsterdam. It was a nice party month. Nick Szabo was never an official Ethereum team member but always helping. He was employed by some bank.

**[12:04] SPEAKER_01:** He did work on the Java client as well.

**[12:06] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, he did the first continuous integration with some others on the Java client. It was mainly Roman Mandalay, who mysteriously disappeared after a few years. I still talked to him at the London Devcon. It was Defcon One, around there with the Ethereum J team. They did Hacker Gold, which was an early 2017 hackathon with some controversy about buying votes. It looked like an exit scam, but it wasn't a good one if it was.

**[12:37] SPEAKER_01:** You mentioned the yellow paper. What was being determined as feature complete or good enough for launch?

**[12:46] SPEAKER_00:** I didn't have a clear idea. Jeff knew what needed to be built and was building massive things single-handedly. I was assigned the task of building the block pool, but Jeff built it in one or two days. Christoph Jentzsch was building the cross-client tests.

**[13:15] SPEAKER_01:** In July 2015, Ming Chan arrived, and there were serious budget cuts. The foundation had burned through most of the money.

**[13:26] SPEAKER_00:** Vitalik said Swarm wouldn't be sworn, but maybe IPFS with an incentive system. Jeff let us keep working on Swarm. There was a ready incentivization scheme for bandwidth incentives and a proper accounting system. Swarm seems to be the only system with this.

**[13:52] SPEAKER_01:** You talked about Devcon Zero. Was that the first time you met quite a number of these people?

**[13:58] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, especially Alex Leverington. He was very adamant and stubborn with his own way of thinking about the protocol. I was trying to learn a lot from him. He brought together the specs for the protocol, but it wasn't really followed.

**[14:22] SPEAKER_01:** Libp2p already existed at that time, part of Protocol Labs and IPFS. Ethereum suffered from the "not invented here" syndrome.

**[14:35] SPEAKER_00:** Devp2p and libp2p had a lot of problems in terms of maintenance. It's not appropriate to start from scratch. In retrospect, it was probably not the best idea.

**[14:52] SPEAKER_01:** The consensus clients now are using libp2p and aren't using RLP anymore. The execution client got stuck with devp2p forever. I remember discussions in 2016 about having both protocols and a bridge protocol.

**[15:12] SPEAKER_00:** It was only after Swarm left the foundation that we switched to libp2p and started Bee client development.

**[15:22] SPEAKER_01:** Devcon Zero was late 2014. Things continued through 2015 up to the July launch.

**[15:30] SPEAKER_00:** Swarm was just an idea, mainly kind of specked out by Zsolt Felföldi. It became a sub-team after that. Felföldi was hired to work on gas, but Jeff told him to work on Swarm. It was a bit sad that it never took off.

**[15:56] SPEAKER_01:** Your journey started with wanting to run an Ethereum node on your smartwatch. The first thing you wanted to do was run an Ethereum node on your smartwatch. You were doing ARM Linux cross builds of CPP Ethereum. Your thought at that time was that light client was still getting worked out, but you'd get a full client working on all these devices. When light client came out, they'd just work, right?

**[16:26] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, we're still suffering from RPC and centralized access. It's not unstoppable.

**[16:36] SPEAKER_01:** It will just come with every Linux distro, just a background service that works.

**[16:43] SPEAKER_00:** 10 years in, these things are starting. The D boot project is building a UEFI client that can bring up any operating system. It's not worked out fully yet, but it seems possible.

**[16:59] SPEAKER_01:** There's a fair bit of networking stuff that would have to happen before you could even start.

**[17:04] SPEAKER_00:** It seems that even before that, you can do it just with the bandwidth. It's kind of a small Linuxoid environment created, and they moved from that to interesting things.

**[17:18] SPEAKER_01:** Through those early years prior to Mainnet launch, what was being determined as feature complete or good enough for launch?

**[17:28] SPEAKER_00:** I didn't have a clear idea. Jeff knew what needed to be built and was building massive things single-handedly. I was assigned the task of building the block pool, but Jeff built it in one or two days. Christoph Jentzsch was building the cross-client tests.

**[17:52] SPEAKER_01:** In July 2015, Ming Chan arrived, and there were serious budget cuts. The foundation had burned through most of the money.

**[18:03] SPEAKER_00:** Vitalik said Swarm wouldn't be sworn, but maybe IPFS with an incentive system. Jeff let us keep working on Swarm. There was a ready incentivization scheme for bandwidth incentives and a proper accounting system. Swarm seems to be the only system with this.

**[18:29] SPEAKER_01:** Can you say a bit about Swarm? The ideas went back a long way.

**[18:35] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, the idea of Swarm came from the realization that decentralization could extend to support the entire web backend. The holy trinity was the Ethereum blockchain as the CPU, Swarm as the hard disk, and Whisper as the messaging layer. The diagram with the circle and apps coming in at the side included QML and Qt as anticipated tech platforms.

**[19:03] SPEAKER_01:** That kind of famous diagram, was that when it first surfaced?

**[19:07] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, around that time. There were a lot of internal meetings as well.

**[19:14] SPEAKER_01:** Was that when the Ethereum logo with the circle and the apps coming in at the side first appeared?

**[19:19] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, it was kind of the crazy protocol names after the ETH, which is also kind of this letter in Icelandic. Ethereum was just one of many related protocols.

**[19:34] SPEAKER_01:** Devcon One was in London in November 2015. What are your memories of that event?

**[19:41] SPEAKER_00:** I was not very easy to follow because I was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2009. I don't know if you remember, but I had, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 15 years ago. And when I did Devcon 1, I was not very, it was not very easy to follow. And here, I don't know, like, literally, a little bit, I was a bit surprised. I didn't remember at the time that I was so sick. such a difficult in terms of my movement. And so I'm sorry for the maybe unsolicited diversion. But yes, as for the content, I remember that we had a very, very successful presentation of Suomi. There was a lot of interest at the time. I was in Shanghai at the second.

**[20:30] SPEAKER_01:** I was looking back at some Devcon 1 videos recently. So many ideas were presented by that point. Anything you could imagine seems to have been presented there.

**[20:43] SPEAKER_00:** I remember when I came in, we thought that from next year, we'd have decentralized services like decentralized delivery or Just Eat, decentralized eBay, decentralized Uber, and Airbnb. These all need Swarm-like things or distributional and scalable data behind them. It came much later.

**[21:06] SPEAKER_01:** But now at least it's working. Can you talk about where Swarm is now and what's happening?

**[21:14] SPEAKER_00:** We have a solid network and have consolidated the protocol. It's kind of the distributed chunk store definition, where nodes communicate and distribute the chunks. It has strong privacy properties and a storage model as well as a distribution network. We implemented kind of this manifest idea, which is a mapping of strings to documents. We got erasure codes implemented maybe two or three years ago. There's also this kind of thing called ENS, which is like the control mechanism that allows you to manage the grantees that can access the file or directory. The mutability is handled by single-owner chunks of feeds, and the integrity of the chunk is by signature.

**[22:07] SPEAKER_01:** Where does Swarm sit compared to IPFS plus Filecoin or Arweave?

**[22:14] SPEAKER_00:** IPFS is widely used also in the Ethereum realm. It's a very good and simple architecture. Filecoin kind of does it in some way. It's mainly good for archival and has very strong availability proofs, which actually work for proving that whatever you store there is available in various replicas. Swarm is very different in that sense. The positive incentives are that you get rewards for storing the chunks that belong to your neighborhood. The pricing and redistribution of the postage stamp revenue is sensitive to some sort of supply signals. It has this nice method of checking supply and therefore set the price based on that. The monetary incentive is what drives the thing from bottom up. It can express with the smart contracts what is kind of self-enforcing. Contracts can express a beautiful incentive system. In Swarm, all kinds of strategic decisions that clients can make are properly incentivized.

**[23:36] SPEAKER_01:** Looking back over these 10 years, has things happened as you thought they might? What you thought Ethereum was at the start, has that been what it's become?

**[23:47] SPEAKER_00:** It fulfills many of its early promises. Some of them are maturing a bit slower than I would have wanted. Proof of stake was supposed to come after a few years, and it kind of happened. Some of these earlier ambitions of proper apps being of Swarm didn't materialize. It's not considered as properly materialized because I think you have Web3 app is as Web3 as the weakest link of it. If you have anything that's not so decentralized in a stack, it's not considered as properly materialized. We still suffer from some of these early neglects, like neglecting clients, neglecting the whole proofs and verification. It's a bit surprising, and it's worth facing that. We're talking about Web3, but it's actually just through our PC, and then we talk NFTs, and then all this kind of stuff, but we talk through our PC, and it's kind of centralized. It's not unstoppable.

**[25:03] SPEAKER_01:** Thank you so much.

**[25:05] SPEAKER_00:** Thank you very much. It was lovely to talk to you and reminisce about the past.

**[25:09] SPEAKER_01:** You too. Okay, thanks so much. Bye-bye.

**[25:12] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, thanks so much. Bye-bye.
