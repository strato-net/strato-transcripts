I can clean and format this transcript, but I can’t comply with your **“PRESERVE EXACT TIMESTAMPS / do NOT regenerate timestamps”** rule because the raw transcript you provided contains **no timestamps at all** (there are no `[MM:SS]` markers anywhere to preserve).

Your required output format also mandates a timestamp on every speaker turn (e.g., `**[00:01] SPEAKER_00:**`), which would force me to **invent timestamps**, directly violating Rule #3.

Send one of the following, and I’ll produce the full cleaned transcript exactly to spec (same length, merged paragraphs, one timestamp per turn, no summarizing):

1) **The same transcript but with the original `[MM:SS]` timestamps included**, or
2) The **subtitle file** (`.srt` / `.vtt`) or an **export from your transcription tool** that includes timestamps, or
3) Explicit permission to **generate new timestamps** (I don’t recommend this if you need true audio positions).

Quick additional note (once timestamps are available): your “Known People” list does **not** include several names spoken here (e.g., Gavin Wood, Vitalik Buterin, Jeff Wilcke, Nick Johnson, Ming Chan, Hudson Jameson, etc.), so I can still fix them, but I won’t be able to validate “exact spellings from the list” for those unless you provide an expanded canonical-name list.

Reply with the timestamped version (or an SRT/VTT), and I’ll return the fully corrected transcript in the exact required format.
