**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** So, hello. I am Bob Summerwill, and this is Early Days of Ethereum with my good friend Victor Tron. So, hi Victor, how are you?

**[00:08] SPEAKER_01:** Very, very well, thank you. Hello Bob. Thank you for inviting me to the show. It's wonderful to reminisce.

**[00:14] SPEAKER_00:** Well, great to have you here. So, yeah, we bumped into each other in Buenos Aires for DevConnect and had hoped to record there, but for one reason or another that never happened. So good to connect with you online instead. So, talking about early days of Ethereum, you were very early in Ethereum. So, I mean, what were you doing in your life prior to that that led you to the project?

**[00:36] SPEAKER_01:** Work-wise? I was not exactly—I wouldn't say I was exactly very close to the crypto scene to be honest. I was working on a project with BBC News Labs, the News Juicer project. He was trying to kind of ingest a lot of new sources like from old photo archives, video archives, and everything, and kind of use it—basically work through the speech recognition and everything—and categorized it and made it searchable in a very nice way. I mean, of course, it's one of these kind of BBC-sponsored projects no one really needed, and it was never really used, but it was a nice project to work on. And anyway, so I kind of left the job.

**[01:20] SPEAKER_00:** At that time you were in London—you were living in London?

**[01:23] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I was in London. I was living in London, and I left the job because I found Ethereum. I was very excited right away. So, I guess it was when Gavin visited this kind of web—new web meetup, some sort—I think it was a new web meetup—and then presented Ethereum. I was absolutely taken aback, and I found it was amazing and a game changer. And I mean, what led me to it to be honest was I was already quite bit into Bitcoin, which is kind of interesting because Bitcoin came into my life through a friend who I knew from an anarchist club or like a Facebook group basically. So it's kind of—he introduced me to it on ideological grounds, but of course I was very interested in tech as well. But it took me quite a while to understand what is blockchain, how all these things come together. But by that time I was kind of solid in understanding of the blockchain, and my manager was solid enough so that I could question Gavin and Vitalik and that it's absolutely not going to work obviously because of this haunting problem. And you know, bit by bit, when I understood that they all had answers to every question that I could ever think of, then that's what I got to admit—that they are probably the geniuses I really, really want to look up to and have in my environment to learn from. It was a very, very great start. And so when Gavin presented Ethereum, the next day I was already hacking on the C codebase, actually. And my first PR—we kind of met in a cafe in Dalston, I think. And I remember those were quite impressive—that I learned that having used Mac, but actually was running it in Linux on it. That was very impressive.

**[02:58] SPEAKER_00:** And so you mentioned your anarchist group there. So had Bitcoin earlier been interesting to you from that kind of monetary, you know, anarchist, libertarian—

**[03:07] SPEAKER_01:** I mean, when Bitcoin came, this was the time when I even kind of learned what money was really. I mean, before I didn't even grasp this notion. And it was very important times in my life. It was really a game changer to kind of have a framework in which I can totally identify myself with—yeah, I don't know if it's the right word, but as a freedom-seeking individual. And I really like this kind of Austrian view of economy and have understood what—how money was used and what inflation was. I never really understood before. That was okay—I came late to the game, let's say. But yeah, and then it was all very—it was history after.

**[03:48] SPEAKER_00:** And the next web meeting that you mentioned—was that like a recurring meetup that you were going to, or were you regularly going to kind of web meetups?

**[03:55] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, but this one particularly stood out because I saw Vitalik's presentation—I think in Miami—and so that really got me interested. So I knew what I was in for when I showed up on that meeting in Hoxton Square. I think it was that meeting.

**[04:10] SPEAKER_00:** Sorry, you said Vitalik's presentation—was that the one that he'd given in Miami?

**[04:13] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, exactly. And so I knew already what I expected from it, but of course I never really understood, and Gavin helped me quite a bit to understand it. So it was really great.

**[04:24] SPEAKER_00:** Had you been watching a variety of Bitcoin conference talks? Was that a sort of regular thing that you were doing at that point—watching?

**[04:31] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, watching YouTube? Yes, and I was very, very interested and very much into these things. I mean, you know, I was hoping that changes related to these kinds of technologies would come a lot earlier. I was already kind of sort of the hype a bit or contributed to it myself in a way.

**[04:48] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, had you been sort of following along with things like Mastercoin and Colored Coins and other sort of Bitcoin 2.0 projects?

**[04:55] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, actually I did. Yeah, it was kind of—I think it was BitShares at the point.

**[05:01] SPEAKER_00:** I'm sorry.

**[05:02] SPEAKER_01:** And there was BitShares, I think.

**[05:04] SPEAKER_00:** Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[05:05] SPEAKER_01:** And there was this kind of—and then Open Transactions, which was very close to Gavin's heart, I think. He worked with—worked together—and yeah, I don't know what came out of that afternoon, but interesting. And then, so after I left the BBC and ready that winter—which I spent in Thailand, half in the retreat—and then in my spare time I was working on the Yellow Paper and worked my way through the really hard notation that Gavin had put on paper.

**[05:35] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, a lot of people struggled with that sort of math-heavy notation. And so you went to Gav's presentation, which would have been very early February. So I mean, that was only like a week or so after Vitalik's presentation in Miami. It would have been very, very close.

**[05:49] SPEAKER_01:** Correct.

**[05:50] SPEAKER_00:** So you spoke to Gav there, and then you exchanged emails, did you?

**[05:54] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, basically we exchanged emails. He put me on a Skype group. There was a Skype group at the time—I think it was 20-odd people on it. Really not a big crowd, and yeah, that's how it all started. So very nice in the beginning too—this kind of grandiose ideas and chat and being part of it. I'm super proud and very happy that I managed to be at the end—at the forefront of it. Many or anyone—it's kind of a lucky move to be honest.

**[06:23] SPEAKER_00:** So was it a fair bit later in that year that you started working with Danny on Swarm? Were you doing—

**[06:28] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, then it came a little bit later. So, first of all, in the spring I started working on the Yellow Paper, and then a bit on the—yeah, as I said, a bit on the C—not a lot. And then I think it was in March or sometime that I showed up on the first Ethereum meetup. Maybe not the first—I think you told me it was not the first but the second one in London.

**[06:50] SPEAKER_00:** This is—

**[06:51] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes, yes, yes.

**[06:52] SPEAKER_00:** So this was organized by Stephan Tual.

**[06:54] SPEAKER_01:** There was a Mihai there who later—I think—

**[06:57] SPEAKER_00:** Sorry, Mihai Alisie? Was that right?

**[06:59] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes. And who I talked to quite a lot was Jack de Rose, who then—

**[07:04] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, of Colony.

**[07:05] SPEAKER_01:** Colony fame. Exactly. And then there—there is when I met Jeff first. So Jeff became my boss later.

**[07:11] SPEAKER_00:** He came to London for that meetup.

**[07:13] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes, he did.

**[07:14] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[07:15] SPEAKER_01:** And that's why I kind of saw that it's quite an international crowd and from all over the world kind of doing this thing. So I kind of started to take it very seriously. As I said, I kind of left my job and enjoyed the ranks, and I kind of started contributing to the Go code. And so after that I kind of—I was really into Golang. That's where I contributed most and became part of the Geth team after Jeff offered me the job around—it was September, October that year—when the foundation was already actively paying out some salaries or like recruiting people on the teams.

**[07:52] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, so I mean, I was looking at the timing on that. So the Ethereum Foundation was founded in July of 2014, and then the crowdsale was going through July, August, September. And then, yeah, the hiring—that first wave of “we've actually got some money to hire people”—was sort of September, September, October, October.

**[08:10] SPEAKER_01:** In October again—if I was negotiating it—Aaron Buchanan, I remember right, right. My contact then. And then I don't know when the Amsterdam office in Wagenstraat was actually founded, but I already visited Jeff, I think later in that year there. And then—so when I first kind of joined, I was talking to my semi with my friends in Hungary. Some of them related to this Facebook group, and among them like Dani Feher. And there was another person who's like very close to Swarm later but never actually entered the scene officially. Let's let him be unnamed. And so there was some thinking that maybe the four of us kind of can form a group and we can just join as a kind of sub-dev team or something. They all feel—I mean, it never happened. So we were just hired—tired of individually. And then—so yes, around that later that year, there was the DevCon 0. Is that correct?

**[09:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah. I mean, if we just pop back a little bit—so could you—so through 2014, you know, prior to the sale and so on—I mean, so how were things working early in 2014? I mean, you mentioned a Skype group. Were most people kind of working through Skype?

**[09:16] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes, yes—it was really mainly, mainly everything was done by basically Gavin, Jeff, and Vitalik. The rest of us were just sharpeners on the way at that time, and then kind of just you know, just tapping up. I mean, I'm talking about the technical stuff. I'm really not sure about the admin and the foundation stuff, so hope no offense is taken from anyone, but yeah—for the tech stuff it's—yeah. So I think it was actually in July that Jeff shared a kind of boot theme to do with me and introduced me into the intricacies of the then aspiring dev P2P protocol. And so I think I was—that was my first project. I think that was really kind of in the codebase that was then the latest scraped and completely reared by Felix and the other guys. But that was my first attempt—I think that to be a networking layer at the time was kind of trying to say really crazy ideas to Jeff about some developer tooling—some like, you know, contract verification—kind of like staging and like fake blockchain environment and stuff. And he was adamant that there were other things to do, and he was focusing on like maybe the end-user applications—like at the time was the Ethereum IDE. I think I was under IDE, but actually later the Mist browser basically, right? It was a browser, and so he was kind of trying to talk me out of it and said that the other group—the C team—is assigned to that anyway, so let me not tread unwanted paths. And so he kind of brought me back to—

**[10:40] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, well I mean he had Aleth. You had Aleth Zero, right? Aleth Zero I guess was an earlier kind of incarnation of that.

**[10:47] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that's good. And then—but there was some—some kind of not-so-glorious tasks as well, that I refactored logging and things like this. I remember in the early days, but there was also a time when I was learning WebAssembly because there was also—not the super popular language—I think a lot of learning to do and yeah.

**[11:06] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, it was relatively new at that point—Go. So you'd mentioned the Yellow Paper. So in those very early months of 2014, Gav in particular seemed to be like incredibly productive in terms of what he was getting through with the C client and that Yellow Paper back—I mean, was it usually the code that was leading and then the Yellow Paper was being kind of modeled after that?

**[11:25] SPEAKER_01:** It's hard for me to say if they really were that kind of hand in hand developing. I think I can't really take—maybe it's better to ask him to be honest. But yes, the productivity—and then actually the speed that he was churning at C++—absolutely stunning. So it's like already a few months after, some of these clients already worked. But yeah, to be honest, I mean Jeff was the same, and Jeff was also incredible in his productivity. These people were really, really nice examples in front of Ruth. So it was really happy to learn from them in a way. Yeah.

**[11:55] SPEAKER_00:** And I mean, I think that triangulation was so important, right—of having multiple clients and the spec—and you had the Python client, though not really to that production status—but you know, those three groups all—

**[12:07] SPEAKER_01:** Who's the new glorious statement that Ethereum always was very proud of—that this multi-client development was leading to very, very solid specs. It's actually true. But of course that was not the reason. But the reason was that all these brilliant individuals just followed their own favorite language and just wanted their own clients to build. But you know, ultimately what came out of it is amazing—like the specification. I just remember just a few times that the specification had to be changed. There's like kind of one case when there's like a modular operation that was not exactly minus—I think it was minus number exactly. Not sure exactly. There was another one—I think it was around Easter 2015—whereas before in the year leading to the launch. And I think that was when it's kind of problem that the uncles had—the two uncles had the same timestamp, I think, and that led to a fork. Remember I wrote up a kind of blog post about this and never, never, never published it. So interesting.

**[12:55] SPEAKER_00:** Talking to Jakob Chapluk—he was an intern at the Berlin office in 2015, but he was telling me about a hard fork that had happened on the mainnet around two weeks or so after launching, which I was completely unaware of. But then looking back, you know, there was a sort of a security announcement by JGoth that was a patching of the Geth client. And while I've been doing stuff myself in terms of like running old clients, I saw that as well—if you run Geth 1.0.0 or Geth 1.0.1, it gets stuck. It can't go through Frontier blocks. So it was actually a hard fork.

**[13:25] SPEAKER_01:** Do you remember what it was related to? It was not that interesting that you remembered.

**[13:29] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, it was some kind of gas counting or something—just some kind of little bug. But that was funny—that was a thing that I—you know, I was not aware about because I—you know, so it was a hard fork, but it was never given a name because it was just an accident.

**[13:42] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, sure.

**[13:43] SPEAKER_00:** And you know, you wonder how many more of these little things there were that happened that are sort of forgotten in the mists of time. Yes, but yeah—so I mean, through that early 2014 year, you were working initially on the C and then later on the Go—I mean, how many people were working on Go in 2014?

**[13:58] SPEAKER_01:** I mean, it was really just a few people around. Jeff, I think, was mainly designer—and designer Alex van de Sande from Brazil—and yeah, and who after him.

**[14:07] SPEAKER_00:** But you were the second team member then, is that right?

**[14:10] SPEAKER_01:** Correct. Just about. Or maybe actually the first officially—I'm not sure. The first paid one—I'm not sure—but I mean we came roughly at the same time with Alex and with—I think with Felix Lange, definitely.

**[14:23] SPEAKER_00:** Right, yeah. In terms of employment. Yeah, but I meant—when you were working earlier, you know, when you started there—I mean, were there other people working on that Go Ethereum ahead of your joining in with him?

**[14:34] SPEAKER_01:** Not really. Not really. So he was—that was pretty much among the ones that contributed the code as far as I remember. And I mean, there was quite, quite a vibrant ecosystem of—yeah, like ecosystem, community of people there—like you know, the later became Slock.it, there was like Nick Savers around—like super tall dude—and we were going together to the Bitcoin conference, I think it was in April.

**[14:55] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, you went to Toronto?

**[14:56] SPEAKER_01:** No, no, it was Amsterdam.

**[14:58] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, okay.

**[14:59] SPEAKER_01:** And that's when I had the chance to really talk to Vitalik quite a bit. It was very nice, and I got a big part as well. So nice, nice, nice time—nice time.

**[15:07] SPEAKER_00:** Nick Savers is a name that I've seen a lot of times, and I—I've never really met or spoken to him. I guess he was around a lot early and then maybe kind of disappeared out—and maybe he's a little bit of an anon guy that doesn't show face.

**[15:18] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I mean he never joined—he was never—I don't think he was ever like officially part of Ethereum, but he was always like—yeah, around and helping us. I think he was employed by some bank.

**[15:28] SPEAKER_00:** But I saw he and some others did the first continuous integration—you know, they were doing the build system, and then he did work on the Java client as well.

**[15:35] SPEAKER_01:** That is true. And Java client was mainly read by—what was his name? Roman Mandl, who kind of mysteriously disappeared after. I'm not sure what happened to him.

**[15:44] SPEAKER_00:** I did see him on Facebook for quite a time. He seems to have either disappeared or something since.

**[15:49] SPEAKER_01:** But I remember at the London DevCon 1, it was definitely around there with the whole Ethereum J team. Yeah, I don't know what their name.

**[15:56] SPEAKER_00:** Was—but Ether Camp.

**[15:58] SPEAKER_01:** That's correct. Thanks for reminding us. Well, nostalgia—all these, all these phrases.

**[16:03] SPEAKER_00:** So yeah, it was early—sort of early 2017 I think that he kind of disappeared. They did hack a gold—and you know, this some kind of like hackathon that there was some controversy about. It looked like the team kind of like bought votes or something but were paid out anyway. And then yeah, he sort of disappeared, with some people thinking he'd exit scammed—but I'm not convinced he did because if he did, it was the worst like exit scam ever because it was so early—you know, like wasn't like anyone had got any kind of big amount of money or anything at that point. Sort of a very poor scam.

**[16:35] SPEAKER_01:** He's definitely enabled and also committed guy.

**[16:38] SPEAKER_00:** So maybe—you'd mentioned about your collaborative sort of sub-team. So that's—that's Ethersphere.

**[16:43] SPEAKER_01:** Well, it's kind of—it was a wishful thinking that it might be Ethersphere, but on the other hand I kind of—I did—I did register that as an organization on GitHub at least, and even I think it was pretty much one of the first Ethereum-related brands in a way. I mean, if I can call it a brand. I think at the time it was only Aryan Industries.

**[17:03] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Yeah. Aris.

**[17:04] SPEAKER_01:** Who later became Monax—this Mammoth Marmot thingy—and they did some nice work by the way. But yeah, so Ethersphere was the home of maybe most of our work, and then we kind of committed through that to the Ethereum codebase.

**[17:17] SPEAKER_00:** So that was yourself? That was yourself, Daniel Nagy.

**[17:20] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. And later George Pfeiffer—already hired to work on the Light client. I think it was in 2015 already. And yeah, because he was not on DevCon 0—but yeah, DevCon 0 was already kind of—I mean, it is very—so Danny and me joining by that time there was quite a bit of—yeah, quite a bit of pass around with him, I think.

**[17:40] SPEAKER_00:** So maybe could you say a bit about Swarm? Because my understanding is that some of the—went an awful long way back.

**[17:47] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So I don't know if you remember—there was in May 2014 a seminal, you know, triad of talks—I think it was in Whitechapel somewhere or somewhere in London. And in that talk, that was the first appearance of Web3 in the Ethereum context. It was like always usually explained. These founders really realized how decentralization can basically also be extended logically to support the entire—be the back end of the entire web. And basically, if you extend it to data—app data—and then hosting—and so basically put a data layer on top—and then maybe the messaging—then you can conceive of it as the world computer with this holy trinity of—you can see them like the Ethereum blockchain as the world computer's CPU, and Swarm will be the disk, and then Whisper would be the kind of messaging layer.

**[18:30] SPEAKER_00:** So you were mentioning Whitechapel. So that was again some meetups—was it that was happening there.

**[18:35] SPEAKER_01:** And I think maybe Ethereum even had some sort of coworking or like some sort of high-end office there—maybe a room or two—because we often found Vitalik there. So not entirely sure how this looks like. I don't want to see anything, but yeah.

**[18:46] SPEAKER_00:** Would that have been when that—

**[18:47] SPEAKER_01:** Lot of internal meetings as well.

**[18:49] SPEAKER_00:** Would that have been when that kind of famous diagram would first have surfaced? You know, the one with like the circle and the apps coming in at the side.

**[18:55] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, that was just about—just about.

**[18:57] SPEAKER_00:** That time—including QML—I saw. So it was not just HTML—it was QML and Qt as other anticipated tech platforms.

**[19:03] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, that's when Web3 was born. And it's kind of the crazy protocol names like after these—which is a—which is also the lettering in Icelandic.

**[19:11] SPEAKER_00:** Oh yeah, the thorn.

**[19:12] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. And so that's when bzz&sh was invented—also Vitalik's gimmicks.

**[19:17] SPEAKER_00:** Those Ethereum—well, the sub-protocols. Right—sub-protocols running on a common basis. But that Ethereum was just one of many related protocols.

**[19:24] SPEAKER_01:** And that's why I was very dedicated to this whole Ethereum at the time. I really kind of understood what it means to have the entire kind of Turing-complete computation being secured on its own with the blockchain. And they kind of really envisioned quite a bit—quite a change in how the Internet works if you have Swarm and Whisper and all these things. So I quite like the idea. And then later I kind of learned that—not only did we socialize on BitTorrent at the time and kind of wanted to improve—but actually some of us like Danny operating at DC node had some legal troubles—maybe, maybe even also kind of talk about this with him at some point. So that's kind of brought us—brought him quite, quite directly in the kind of realm of implementing Swarm—this idea of a decentralized storage and incentivization, etc.—and name resolution. One, one—let me see—you connected.

**[20:10] SPEAKER_00:** And Zolt had mentioned to me that he thought that the idea for Swarm had gone back to at least 2011.

**[20:15] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, so—yeah, so there was this idea—I don't know about that—but it was mainly, mainly Danny's idea that—I mean, he saw the amazing, amazing qualities of BitTorrent, but he also saw some drawbacks. So many historically it's best to derive the whole idea of Swarm from them. And because BitTorrent was difficult—like starting a download—there's all this kind of voice and throttling, throttling rules. And of course didn't have the proper incentives to keep the data. And also of course had the problem with the individual bits of the file not being addressable right away. You had to use a tracker to resolve them. And of course that there's also a problem with the—how, you know, how much the previous interviews in parallels. Because I mean, as you remember, you know, for example, in Germany there was legal prosecution for who used BitTorrent.

**[21:02] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, I didn't know that.

**[21:03] SPEAKER_01:** And I mean—not the time, but I mean much later—but yeah. So I think what Dani was trying to do is like came up with an idea of how to chunk things—in a way, every chunk is kind of content-addressable, and also kind of that some of the placement of chunks is also part of the DHT. So normally a DHT—like a DHT table—is basically the idea that you put node IDs and then kind of chunk or IDs of content basically in the same space, and somehow you get information—what's the location—like, who to download it from—about these chunks from neighborhoods that have the same address or like—yeah, similar address. So there's usually a metric on this. If you use the logarithmic distance like that, then you can work with Kademlia and it's Kademlia networks. You kind of iterate through the peers—you keep a few peers connected and you go—so then you go closer one to this guy, to this guy and the hash of Star Wars, and you want to watch Star Wars, and then you go him up and ultimately you see where the chunks are—we can download from. Obviously this is not very private, so—and then—and also kind of it's not very—as you know from this kind of legal problems—that it's also not very deniable. And if you have—if you have enforced certain chunks should reside, so you kind of enforce a kind of orange layer on top of it, then you can probably deny that you know anything about it—system that enforces that parts of parts of the Star Wars story. Basically, it was Danny's genius idea that I think we call it the DPA. He sent us to preimage archive. So basically an archive of preimages—there's a bit of data that the image of is the hash. Yet the preimage is what's before the hashing—the actual piece of the data. And so this idea of actually storing not the location but the actual data at the place in the DHT—has direct DHT interpretation—was the DPA. And that was kind of a very important, very important notion that came and then became very important in this form. And then yeah, and then a lot of other things came. So I remember that we were in 2015—fishing or fourth diameter—and that winter day we were sitting in the Arena Plaza in Budapest—the three of us with FeFe—talking about this and how to start implementing because there was a pressure to obviously implement the whole thing with using UDP as the networking stack because it was considered that like TCP is too heavy and too slow. But then obviously that at the time you already had the devp2p—it's very, very easy to implement it and then try this protocol. So I suggested that maybe instead of using UDP, just use TCP but use it—forwarding keep-alive—some connections—Phase I connections, Phase I permanent connections with the peers—and just use the Kademlia with the through the live connections that each forwarding—like reach locally decided to forward to the closer node and ultimately move backward—like you forward the request and you backward the chunk after all. And so it was—it seemed like very easy to implement. And we did exactly that. Turned out to be one of the best and most interesting choices of Swarm. It turns out that that's what allows the kind of peer-to-peer accounting to be working. And also this kind of gives the—gives the privacy features that this form has—basically obscures the originator of the request. If you think about it, no one knows that. And when someone megaderp is asking you something and they want to watch Star Wars—or you know, or someone upstream wants to watch—and also kind of it directly solved the opportunistic caching problem—how to distribute automatically popular content. So with the retrieval paths or the forwarding PIs can just remember some of the chunks. So it's very, very interesting how these—how these ideas like started and then basically kind of coalesced in 2016. 2016 Swarm—I think, I think the first, the very first release surfed in Geth 1.5. Second—so it was December 2016. Yes. For public pilot was released, and I remember there was already kind of how we viewed video—we call it streaming, but it's actually not real-time streaming. It's like just watch the video file. There was a nice tweet about that too.

**[24:00] SPEAKER_00:** And just to take a step back—so I mean, my understanding of a primary thought that there was with Swarm was that because you could have this—you know, the holy trinity, right—of sort of like decentralized compute—the blockchain—Swarm for the decentralized file system and storage—and then Whisper for that decentralized messaging—that you could have this really nice kind of synergy of say a primary issue which is still really not solved of saying—well, how do you host the web front end to make a whole application? Yes, you need your smart contracts and your transactions and things—but you need an application wrapping around that. So really the thought that if you had a decentralized storage mechanism that could store like the HTML and the JavaScript and so on—that you want like an incentive system so that that stuff is available if people want it. You know, that you don't have a tragedy of the commons where only most popular content is available. But also because if you are building on Ethereum—you've got the cryptocurrency to do the incentives—you've got the smart contract system that allows you to implement those incentive systems—and all of these things can fit together into a holistic unstoppable whole of saying—well, here you go—you've got your applications which cannot be stopped—but that's the full stack. And it seems even now that there's an awful lot of stuff which is dependent on centralized hosted services—and it's very central.

**[25:15] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah—I'm pretty sad about this, to be honest. I mean, there's a lot of these things—like I don't know if you remember this big—I don't know—was it Bitfinex? That was the biggest crypto heist ever because of the—because of the Safe hack. If that had been using Swarm, then it was much more difficult to change all these kind of transactions under the hood because they had to—what they had to do is like they hacked the person—had the dev's account—and then uploaded something through S3 which then the Safe wallet used. And of course these are much more difficult to do if these things are—the content is addressed—of course registered. This is how these things work—like, you know, you start from the blockchain—which that single source of truth—like ENS or services as a name—you resolve it to content hash—and then the content hash is retrieved from these decentralized stores.

**[26:05] SPEAKER_00:** And I mean again—that 2016 kind of era was when ENS was coming to life as well. So yeah, I mean that's another thing actually.

**[26:11] SPEAKER_01:** Nick Johnson was first part of the Swarm team—as part of the Swarm team. He developed the ENS and then later took off.

**[26:17] SPEAKER_00:** I didn't know he worked on Swarm. I knew he was part of the Geth team. But he did some Swarm as well, eh?

**[26:22] SPEAKER_01:** Well, definitely—yeah, I recruited him to be honest.

**[26:25] SPEAKER_00:** Fantastic. Did you know him in London?

**[26:27] SPEAKER_01:** No, no, no. I mean, he was just part of the community—valuable contributions
