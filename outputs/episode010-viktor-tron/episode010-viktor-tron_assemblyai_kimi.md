**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** So hello, I am Bob Summerwill and this is Early Days of Ethereum with my good friend Viktor Trón. So hi Viktor, how are you?

**[00:15] SPEAKER_01:** Very, very well, thank you. Hello Bob. Thank you for inviting me to the show. It's wonderful to reminisce.

**[00:30] SPEAKER_00:** Well, great to have you here. So. So yeah, we, we bumped into each other in Buenos Aires for Devconnect and had hoped to record there but for one reason or another that never happened. So good to connect you online instead. So talking about early days of Ethereum, you were very early in Ethereum. So I mean what were you doing in your life prior to that that led you to the project.

**[00:50] SPEAKER_01:** Work wise? I was not exactly, I wouldn't say I was exactly. Very close to the, close to the crypto scene to be honest. I was working on a project with BBC News Labs News Juicer project. He was trying to kind of ingest a lot of new sources like from old photo archives, video archives and everything and kind of use it like basically work through the speech recognition and everything and categorized it and made it searchable in a very nice way. I mean of course it's one of the, one of these kind of BBC sponsored projects no one really needed and it was never really used but, but it was, it was a nice project to work on and anyway, so I kind of left. Left the job.

**[01:50] SPEAKER_00:** At that time you were in London, you were living in London?

**[02:05] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I was in London. I was living in London and I left the job because, because I found Ethereum. I was very excited right away. So when, I guess it was when Gavin visited this kind of web new web meetup some sort, I think it was a new web meetup and then presented Ethereum, I was absolutely taken back and I found it was amazing and game changer. And I mean what led me to it to be honest was I was already quite bit into bitcoin which kind of interesting because bitcoin came into my life through a friend who I knew from an anarchist club or like Facebook group basically. So it's kind of. He introduced me to it on ideological grounds but of course I was very interested in tech as well, so. But it took me quite a while to understand what is blockchain, how all these things come together. But by that time I was kind of solid in understanding of the blockchain and my understanding was solid enough so that I could. I was questioning Gavin and Vitalik and that it's absolutely not going to work obviously because of this halting problem. And you know, and bit by bit when I understood that they all had answers to every question that I can ever think of. Then that's what I got to admit that they are probably the geniuses I really, I really want to look up to and have in my environment to learn from. It was very, very, very great start. And so when Gavin presented the Ethereum I was. Next day I was already hacking on the C++ codebase actually and my first PR in. We kind of met in a cafe in Dalston I think. And I remember those were quite impressive that I learned that having used Mac but actually was running Linux on it. That was very impressive.

**[04:30] SPEAKER_00:** And so you know, you mentioned your anarchist group there. So had Bitcoin earlier been interesting to you from that kind of monetary, you know, anarchist, libertarian.

**[04:50] SPEAKER_01:** I mean when Bitcoin came, this was the time when I even kind of learned what money was really. I mean before I didn't even, didn't even grasp this notion. And it was very important times in my life. It was really a game changer to kind of have a framework in which I can totally identify myself with. Yeah, I don't know if it's the right word, but freedom seeking individual and I really like this kind of Austrian view of economy and have understood what, what how money was. Was used and what inflation was never really understood before. That was okay, I came late to the game, let's say, let's say that. But yeah, and then, and then it was all very. It was a history after.

**[05:35] SPEAKER_00:** And. And the, the next web meeting that you mentioned was that like a recurring meetup that you were going to or were you regularly going to kind of, you know, web meet up?

**[05:50] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, but, yes, but this, this one particularly sort out because I saw Vitalik's presentation I think in Miami and so that really got me interested. So I knew what I was in for when I showed up on that meeting in Hoxton Square. I think it was that meeting.

**[06:15] SPEAKER_00:** Sorry, you said Vitalik's presentation, was that the one that he'd given in Miami?

**[06:30] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, exactly. And there was a. So kind of. I knew already what I expect from it, but of course I never really understood and Gavin helped me quite a bit to, to understand it. So it was really great.

**[06:50] SPEAKER_00:** Had you. Were you watching a variety of, of like bitcoin conference talks? Was that a sort of a regular thing that you were doing at that point? Watching.

**[07:05] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, watching YouTube? Yes, and I was very, very interested and very much into, into these things. I mean, you know, I was hoping that you know, change changes related to this kind of technologies we Come a lot earlier. Was already kind of sort of the hype a bit or contributed to it myself in a way and.

**[07:35] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, had you. Had you been sort of following along with things like Mastercoin and Colored Coins and other sort of Bitcoin 2.0 projects?

**[07:50] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, actually I did. Yeah. It was kind of a. I think it was at the point. And there was BitShares, I think.

**[08:25] SPEAKER_00:** I'm sorry.

**[08:30] SPEAKER_01:** And there was BitShares, I think. And there was this kind of. And then Open Transactions which very close to kind of Gavin's heart, I think. Worked with work together and Yeah, I don't know what came out on that afternoon, but. Interesting. And then so after I left the BBC and ready that winter which I spent in Thailand, half in the retreat and then in my spare time I was working on the Yellow Paper and worked my way through the really hard notation that Gavin had put on paper.

**[09:30] SPEAKER_00:** Yes. A lot of people struggled with that sort of math heavy notation and, and, and so you. So you went to Gav's presentation which was. Would have been very early February. So I mean that was only like a week or so after Vitalik's presentation in Miami. It would have been very, very close.

**[10:00] SPEAKER_01:** Correct.

**[10:05] SPEAKER_00:** So you spoke to Gav there and then you exchanged emails, did you?

**[10:20] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, basically we changed emails. Changed emails. He put me on Skype group. There was a Skype group at the time, I think it was 20 odd people on it. Really not a big crowd and yeah, that's how it all started. So very nice in the beginning too. This kind of grandiose ideas and chat and be part of it. I'm super proud and very happy that I managed to be at the end, at the forefront of it. Many or anyone. It's kind of a lucky move to be honest.

**[11:20] SPEAKER_00:** So was it a fair bit later in that year that you started working with. With Danny on Swarm? Were you doing.

**[11:35] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Then. Then it came a little bit later. So. So yes, first of all, first of all in the spring started working on the Yellow Paper and then a bit on the. Yeah, as I said, bit on the C++. Not a lot. And then I think it was in March or sometime that. That I was a. I showed up on the first Ethereum meetup. Maybe not the first. I think you told me it was not the first but the second one in London.

**[13:30] SPEAKER_00:** This is.

**[13:35] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes, yes, yes.

**[13:40] SPEAKER_00:** So this was organized by Stefan Tual.

**[13:50] SPEAKER_01:** There was a. There was a Mihai there who later kind of I think. And then.

**[14:05] SPEAKER_00:** Sorry, Mihai Alisie. Was that right?

**[14:20] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes. And And I think who I talked to quite a lot was Jack du Rose, who then.

**[14:35] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, of Colony.

**[14:40] SPEAKER_01:** Colony fame. Exactly. So. And then, and then, there is when I met Jeff first. So Jeff became my boss later.

**[15:15] SPEAKER_00:** He came to London for that meetup.

**[15:25] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes, he did.

**[15:35] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[15:40] SPEAKER_01:** And that's why I kind of saw that it's, it's quite an international crowd and from all over the world kind of doing this thing. So I kind of started to take it very seriously. As I said, I kind of left my job and enjoyed the ranks and I kind of started contributing to the Go code. And so after that I kind of. I was really into the Golang. That's where I contributed most and become part of the Geth team after. After Jeff offered me the job around. It was September, October that year when the foundation was already actively paying out some salaries or like recruiting people on the teams.

**[17:20] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, so I mean I was looking at the timing on that. So the Ethereum Foundation was founded in July of 2014 and then the crowd sale was going through July, August, September. And then, yeah, the, the hiring, that first wave of we've actually got some money to hire people was, was sort of, you know, September, September, October, October.

**[17:50] SPEAKER_01:** In October again, if I was negotiating it. Aeron Buchanan, I remember right, right. My contact then. And then I don't know when the Amsterdam office in Wurstraat was actually funded, but I already visited Jeff, I think later in that year there. So. And then. So when I first kind of joined, I was talking to my semi with my friends in Hungary. Some of them related to this Facebook group and among them like Dani F.. And there was another person who's like very close to Swarm later but never actually entered the scene officially. Let's let him be unnamed. And so there was some thinking that maybe the four of us kind of can form a group and we can just join as a kind of sub dev team or something. They all feel, I mean, it never happened. So we work at times just higher. Tired of individually. And then. And then. So yes, around that later that year, there was the Devcon 0. Is that correct?

**[19:55] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah. I mean if we just, just pop back a little bit. So could you. Could you. So through 2014, you know, prior to, you know, the sale and so on, I mean, so how were things working early in 2014? I mean, you mentioned a Skype group. Were most people kind of working through Skype?

**[20:15] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes, yes, it was really mainly, Mainly everything was done by basically by Gavin, Jeff and Vitalik. The rest of Us were just sharpers on the way at that time and then kind of just you know, just tapping up. I mean I'm talking about the technical stuff. I'm really not sure about the admin and the foundation stuff so hope no offense is taken from anyone but yeah for the tech stuff it's. Yeah. So I think it was actually in July that Jeff shared a kind of to-do list with me and introduced me into the intricacies of the then aspiring devp2p protocol. And so I think I was. That was my first project. I think that was really kind of in the code base that was then the latest scraped and. And completely reared them by Felix and the other guys. But that was my first attempt. I think that to be a networking layer at the time was kind of trying to say really crazy ideas to Jeff about some developer tooling some like you know, contract verification kind of like staging and like fake blockchain environment and stuff. And he was adamant that there other things to do and he was focusing on like maybe the end user end user applications like the. At the time was the Eth? I think I was under Esco but actually later the Mist browser basically right. It was a browser and so he was kind of trying to talk me out of it and said that the other group the C++ team is assigned to that anyway so let me not thread unwanted paths. And so he kind of brought me back to.

**[23:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, well I mean he had Aleph. You had AlethZero, right? AlethZero I guess was an earlier kind of incarnation of that.

**[23:15] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that's good. And then. But there was some. Some kind of not so not so glorious tasks as well that I refactor logging and things like this. I remember in the early days but there was also a time when I was. I was kind of learning. Learning Go because there was also not the super popular language I think a lot of learning to do and yeah.

**[23:50] SPEAKER_00:** I mean it was relatively new at that point. Go. So you'd mentioned the Yellow Paper. So in those very early months of 2014 Gav in particular seemed to be like incredibly productive in terms of what he was getting through with the C++ client and that Yellow Paper back, I mean was it usually the code that was leading and then the Yellow Paper was being kind of modeled after that.

**[24:20] SPEAKER_01:** It's hard for me to say if they really were that kind of hand in hand developing. I think I can't really take. Maybe it's better as him to be honest but. But yes the productivity and then. And actually the speed that he Was churning out C++ code. Absolutely stunning. So it's like already a few months after some of these clients already worked. But yeah, to be honest, I mean Jeff was the same and Jeff was also incredible in his productivity. These people were really, really nice example in front of me. So I was really happy to learn from them in a way. Yeah.

**[25:05] SPEAKER_00:** And I mean I think that that triangulation was so important right of having multiple clients and the spec and you had the Python client though not really to that production status but you know those, those three groups all, you know.

**[25:20] SPEAKER_01:** Who's the new glorious statement that Ethereum always was very proud of that like this multi client development was leading to very, very solid specs. It's actually true. But of course that was not the reason. But the reason was that all these brilliant individuals just followed their own favorite language and just wanted their own clients to build. But you know, ultimately what came out of it is amazing. Like the specification. I just remember just a few times that the specification had to be, had to be changed. There's like kind of one case when there's like a modular operation that was not exactly minus, I think it was minus number exactly. Not sure exactly. There was another one, I think it was around Easter 2015, whereas before in the year leading to the launch. And I think that was when it's kind of problem that the uncle blocks had. The two uncles had the same timestamp I think and that led to a fork. Remember I wrote up a kind of blog post about this and never, never, never published it. So interesting.

**[26:50] SPEAKER_00:** Talking to Jakob Chapluk. So he was an intern at the Berlin office in 2015 but he was telling me about a hard fork that had happened on the mainnet around two weeks or so after launching, which I was completely unaware of. But then looking back, you know, there was a sort of a security announcement by Geth of patching of the Geth client. And while I've been doing stuff myself in terms of like running old clients, I saw that as well. If you run Geth 1.0.0 or Geth 1.0.1, it. It gets stuck. It can't go through Frontier blocks. So it was actually a hard fork.

**[27:35] SPEAKER_01:** Do you remember what it was related to? It was not that interesting that you remembered.

**[27:45] SPEAKER_00:** I mean it was, it was some kind of gas counting or something, you know, just some kind of, some kind of little bug. But, but that was funny. That was a thing that I, you know, I was not aware about because I, you know, so it was a hard fork but it was never given a name because it was just an accident.

**[28:10] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, sure.

**[28:15] SPEAKER_00:** And, and you know, you wonder how many more of these little things there were that happened that sort of forgotten in the mists of time. Yes, but yeah, so I mean through that early 2014 year you were working initially on the C++ and then later on the Go, I mean was like how many people were working on Go in 2014?

**[28:40] SPEAKER_01:** I mean it was really just a few people around. Jeff I think was mainly designer and designer Alex van de Sande from Brazil and. Yeah, and who after him.

**[29:05] SPEAKER_00:** But you were the second team member then, is that right?

**[29:20] SPEAKER_01:** Correct. Just about. Or maybe actually the first officially, I'm not sure. The first paid one, I'm not sure but I mean we came roughly at the same time with Alex and with, I think with Felix Lange, definitely.

**[29:50] SPEAKER_00:** Right, yeah. In terms of, in terms of employment. Yeah but I meant, I meant when you were working earlier, you know, when you, when you started there, I mean, were there other people working on that Go Ethereum ahead of your joining in with him?

**[30:20] SPEAKER_01:** Not really. Not really. So he was, that was pretty much among ones that contributed the code as far as I remember. And I mean there was quite, quite a vibrant ecosystem of. Yeah, like ecosystem, community of people there. Like you know, the later became Sloky, there was like Nick Savers around like super tall dude and we were going together to the, the Bitcoin conference, I think it was in April.

**[31:05] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, you went to Toronto?

**[31:10] SPEAKER_01:** No, no, it was, it was Amsterdam.

**[31:20] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, okay.

**[31:25] SPEAKER_01:** And that's when I had the chance to really talk to, to Vitalik quite a bit. It was very nice and I got a big parted as well. So nice, nice, nice time with this nice time time.

**[31:45] SPEAKER_00:** Nick Savers is a name that I've seen a lot of times and I, I, I, I've never really met or spoken to him. I guess he was around a lot early and then maybe kind of disappeared out and maybe he's a little bit of a anon guy that doesn't, you know, show face.

**[32:05] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I mean he never joined. He was never, I don't think he was ever like officially part of the team, but he was always like, yeah, around and helping us. I think he was employed by some bank.

**[32:20] SPEAKER_00:** But I saw he and some others did the first continuous integration, you know, they were doing the build system and then he did work on the Java client as well.

**[32:35] SPEAKER_01:** That is true. And Java client was mainly read by what was his name? Roman Mandeleev, who kind of mysteriously disappeared after. I'm not sure what happened to Him.

**[32:50] SPEAKER_00:** I did see him on Facebook for quite a time. He seems to have either disappeared or something since.

**[33:00] SPEAKER_01:** But I remember at the London Devcon 1 it was definitely around there with the whole EthereumJ team. Yeah, I don't know what their name.

**[33:15] SPEAKER_00:** Was but Ether.Camp.

**[33:25] SPEAKER_01:** That's correct. Thanks. Thanks for reminding us. Well, nostalgia, all these, all these phrases.

**[33:35] SPEAKER_00:** So yeah, it was early, sort of early 2017 I think that he kind of of disappeared. They did a hackathon and you know this, this some kind of like hackathon that there was some controversy about. It looked like the team kind of like bought votes or something but were paid out anyway. And then yeah, he sort of disappeared with some people thinking he'd exit scammed but I'm not convinced he did because if he did it was the worst like exit scam ever because it was so early, you know, like wasn't like anyone had got any kind of big amount of money or anything at that point. Sort of a very poor scam.

**[34:15] SPEAKER_01:** He's definitely enabled and also committed guy.

**[34:25] SPEAKER_00:** So maybe. So you'd mentioned about, you'd mentioned about, you know, your, your sort of collaborative sort of sub team. So that's, that's Ethersphere.

**[34:40] SPEAKER_01:** Well, it's kind of. It was, it was a wishful thinking that it might be Ethersphere but on the other hand I kind of, I did, I did register that as an organization on GitHub at least and even I think it was pretty much the one of the first Ethereum related brands in a way. I mean if I can call it a brand. I mean I think at the time it was only Eris Industries.

**[35:10] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Yeah. Aris.

**[35:15] SPEAKER_01:** Who later became Monax, this is Mammoth Marmot thingy and they did some nice work by the way. But yeah, so Ethersphere was the home of maybe most of our work and then we kind of committing through that to the, to the Ethereum code base.

**[35:35] SPEAKER_00:** So that was yourself? That was yourself, Daniel Nagy.

**[35:50] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. And later George Pfeffer like already hired to work on the Light client. I think it was in 2015 already. And yeah, because he was not on Devcon 0 but yeah, Devcon 0 was already kind of. I mean it is very. So Danny and me joining by that time there was quite a bit of. Yeah, quite a bit of pass around with him I think.

**[36:20] SPEAKER_00:** So maybe could you say a bit about Swarm? Because my understanding is that some of the. Went an awful long way back.

**[36:35] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So I don't know if you remember there was in May, May 2014 there was a seminal, you know, triad of talks in I think it was in Whitechapel somewhere or somewhere Islam. And in that talk that was the first appearance of web3 in the Ethereum context. It was like always usually explained. These founders really realized how decentralization can basically also be extended and logical to support the entire. Be the back end of the entire web. And basically if you extend it to data, app data and then hosting and so basically put a data layer on top and then maybe the messaging, then you can conceive of it as the world computer with this holy trinity of. You can see them like the Ethereum blockchain as the world computer's CPU and disk will be Swarm and then Whisper would be the kind of messaging layer.

**[38:10] SPEAKER_00:** So you were mentioning Whitechapel. So that was again some meetups was it? That was happening there.

**[38:25] SPEAKER_01:** And I think maybe maybe Ethereum even had some sort of co working or like some sort of high end office there, maybe maybe a room or two because we often found Vitalik there. So not entirely sure how this looks like. I don't want to say anything but yeah.

**[38:50] SPEAKER_00:** Would that have been when that a.

**[39:00] SPEAKER_01:** Lot of internal meetings as well.

**[39:05] SPEAKER_00:** Would that have been when that kind of famous diagram would first have surfaced? You know the one with like the circle and the apps coming in at the side.

**[39:20] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, that was just about, just about.

**[39:30] SPEAKER_00:** That time including QML I saw. So it was not just HTML, it was QML and QT as other anticipated tech platforms.

**[39:40] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, that's when Web3 was born. And it's kind of the crazy protocol names like bzz and shh after these. Which is a. Which is also the lettering in Icelandic.

**[40:00] SPEAKER_00:** Oh yeah, the thorn.

**[40:05] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. And so that's when bzz and shh was invented. Also Vitalik's gimmicks.

**[40:15] SPEAKER_00:** Those Ethereum. Well, the sub protocols. Right, sub protocols running on a common basis. But that Ethereum was just one of many related protocols.

**[40:25] SPEAKER_01:** And that's why I was very dedicated to this whole Ethereum at the time. I really kind of understood what it means to have the entire kind of Turing complete computation being secured on its own with the blockchain. And they kind of really envisioned quite a bit, quite a change in how the Internet works if you have Swarm and Whisper and all these things. So I quite like the idea. And then later I kind of learned that, you know, not only did we socialize on BitTorrent at the time and kind of wanted to improve, but actually some of us like Danny operating a DC++ node had some legal troubles maybe, maybe even also kind of talk about this with him at some point. So that's kind of brought us, brought him quite, quite directly in the kind of realm of implementing Swarm. This idea of a decentralized storage and incentivization, etc. And name resolution, let me see you connected.

**[41:50] SPEAKER_00:** And Zolt had mentioned to me that he thought that the idea for Swarm had gone back to at least 2011.

**[42:05] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, so. Yeah, so there was this idea, of course, I don't know about that, but. But it was mainly, mainly Danny's idea that. I mean he saw the amazing, amazing qualities of BitTorrent, but he also saw some drawbacks. So many historically it's best to derive the whole idea of Swarm from them. And because BitTorrent was difficulty like starting a download, there's all this kind of voice and throttling, throttling rules. And of course didn't have the proper incentives to keep the data. And also of course had the problem with the individual bits of the file not being addressable right away. You had to use a tracker to resolve them. And of course that there's also a problem with the, with how, you know, how, how much the previous interviews in Parallels. Because I mean, as you remember, you know, for example, in Germany there was legal prosecution for people who used BitTorrent.

**[43:30] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, I didn't know that.

**[43:35] SPEAKER_01:** And I mean, not the time, but I mean much later, but yeah. So I think what Dani was trying to do is like came up with an idea of how to chunk things. In a way, every chunk is kind of content addressable and also kind of that some of the placement of chunks is also part of the DHT. So normally a DHT like a distributed hash table is basically the idea that you put node IDs and then kind of chunk or IDs of content basically in the same space and somehow you get information. What's the location, like, who to download it from? About these chunks from neighborhoods that have the same address or like. Yeah, similar address. So there's usually a metric on this. If you use the logarithmic distance like that, then you can work with Kademlia and it's Kademlia networks. You kind of iterate through the peers like you keep a few peers connected and you go. So then you go closer one to this guy, to this guy and the hash of Star wars and you want to watch Star wars and then you go him up and ultimately you see what. Where the chunks are we can download from. Obviously this is not very private, so. And then. And also kind of it's not Very as you know from the. From this kind of legal problems that it's also not very deniable. And if you have. If you have enforced certain chunks should reside so you kind of enforce a kind of storage layer on top of it, then you can probably deny that you know anything about it system that enforces that parts of parts of the Star wars story. Basically it was Danny's genius idea that I think we call it the DPA. He sent us the Distributed Preimage Archive. So basically an archive of preimages. There's a bit of data that the image of is the hash. Yet the pre image is what's before the hashing the actual piece of the data. And so this idea of actually storing not the location but the actual data at the place in the DHT has direct DHT interpretation was the DPA. And that was kind of a very important, very important notion that came and then became very important in this form. And then yeah, and then a lot of other things came. So I remember that we were in 2014 or something. And that winter day we were sitting in the Arena Plaza in Budapest the three of us with Fefe talking about this and how to start implementing because there was a pressure to obviously implement the whole thing with using UDP as the networking stack because it was considered that like TCP is too heavy and to too slow. But then obviously that at the time you already had the devp2p it's very very easy to implement it and then try this protocol. So I suggested that maybe instead of using UDP just use TCP but use it forwarding keep alive some connections Phase I connections, Phase I permanent connections with the peers and just use the Kademlia with the through the live connections that each forwarding like reach locally decided to forward to the closer node and ultimately move backward. Like you forward the request and you backward the chunk after all. And so it was. It seemed like very easy to implement. And we did exactly that. Turned out to be one of the. One of the best and most interesting choices of Swarm. It turns out that that's what allows the kind of peer to peer accounting to be working. And also this kind of gives the. Gives the privacy features that this form has basically office case the originator of the request. If you think about it, no one knows that. And when someone upstream is asking you something and they want to watch the Star wars or you know, or someone upstream wants to watch and also kind of it directly solved the opportunistic caching problem, how to distribute automatically popular content. So with the retrieval paths or the forwarding peers can just remember some of the chunks. So it's very, very interesting how these, how these ideas like started and then basically kind of coalesced in 2016. I think the first, the very first release was in Geth 1.5. Second so it was a, it was December 2016. Yes. For public pilot was released and I remember there was already kind of how we viewed video. We call it streaming, but it's actually not real time streaming. It's like just watch the video file. There was a nice tweet about that too.

**[49:15] SPEAKER_00:** And just to take a step back, so I mean my understanding of a primary thought that there was with Swarm was that because you could have this, you know, the holy trinity, right of sort of like decentralized compute database, the blockchain Swarm for the decentralized file system and storage and then Whisper for that decentralized messaging that you could have this really nice kind of synergy of say a primary issue which is still really not solved of saying, well, how do you host the web front end to make a whole application? Yes, you need your smart contracts and your transactions and things, but you need an application wrapping around that. So really the thought that if you had a decentralized storage mechanism that could store like the HTML and the JavaScript and so on, that you want like an incentive system so that that stuff is available if people want it.
