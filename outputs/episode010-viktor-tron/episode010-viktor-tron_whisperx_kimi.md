**[00:01] SPEAKER_01:** So, hello. I am Bob Summerwill and this is Early Days of Ethereum with my good friend Viktor Trón. So, hi Viktor, how are you?

**[00:06] SPEAKER_00:** Very, very well, thank you. Hello Bob, thank you for inviting me to the show, it's wonderful.

**[00:11] SPEAKER_01:** Well, great to have you here. So, we bumped into each other in Buenos Aires for DevConnect and I'd hoped to record there, but for one reason or another that never happened, so good to connect with you online instead. So, talking about early days of Ethereum, you were very early in Ethereum. So, what were you doing in your life prior to that that led you to the project?

**[00:30] SPEAKER_00:** Not exactly. I wouldn't say I was exactly very close to the crypto scene, to be honest. I was working on a project with the BBC News Labs, basically a news juicer project. It was trying to ingest a lot of news sources like from old photo archives, video archives and everything, and kind of juice it, basically work through the speech recognition and everything and categorize it and make it searchable in a very nice way. It was one of these BBC sponsored projects. No one really needed it, it was never really used, but it was a nice project to work on. Anyway, so I kind of left the job at that time.

**[01:12] SPEAKER_01:** You were in London? You were living in London?

**[01:14] SPEAKER_00:** So yeah, I was in London. I was living in London. And I left the job because I found Ethereum. I was very excited right away. So when, I guess it was when Gavin visited this new web meetup, and presented Ethereum, I was absolutely taken aback, and I thought it was amazing and game-changer. What led me to it was I was already quite a bit into Bitcoin, which is kind of interesting. Bitcoin came into my life through a friend who I knew from an anarchist Facebook group. So he introduced me to it on ideological grounds. But of course, I was very interested in tech as well. It took me quite a while to understand what is blockchain, how all these things come together. But by that time I was solid in understanding the blockchain, and my knowledge was solid enough so that I could question Gavin and then Vitalik. I said this is absolutely not going to work, obviously, because of this whole thing problem. Bit by bit, when I understood that they all had answers to every question that I could ever think of, then that's when I got convinced that they're probably the geniuses I really can look up to and have in my biography to learn from. It was a very, very great start. So when Gavin presented Ethereum, next day I was already hacking on the C++ codebase actually, and had my first PR in. We met in a cafe in Dalston, I think. I remember it was quite impressive that I learned how to use Mac, but actually was running Linux OS on it, it was very impressive already.

**[02:55] SPEAKER_01:** And you mentioned your anarchist group there. Had Bitcoin earlier been interesting to you from that kind of monetary, you know, anarchist, libertarian?

**[03:03] SPEAKER_00:** I have to say yes. I mean, when Bitcoin came, this was the time when I even kind of learned what money was really. I mean, before I didn't even grasp this notion. And it was very important times in my life. I mean, it was really a game changer to kind of have a framework in which I could totally identify myself with. I really like this kind of Austrian view of economy. And I understood what, how our money was used and what inflation was. I never really understood before. I came late to the game, let's say. But yeah. And then it was all very...

**[03:47] SPEAKER_01:** Was it a history after and the next web meeting that you mentioned, was that like a recurring meetup that you were going to or were you regularly going to kind of web meetups?

**[03:56] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, but this one particularly I saw because I saw Vitalik's presentation in Miami and so that really got me interested, so I knew what I was in for, and I went and showed up for that meeting in Houston Square, I think it was, that meeting.

**[04:11] SPEAKER_01:** Sorry, you said Vitalik's presentation, was that the one he'd given in Miami?

**[04:15] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, exactly, Miami conference. And there was a So I kind of, I knew what, I knew already what I expect from it, but of course I never really understood and Gavin helped me quite a bit to understand it. So it was really great.

**[04:29] SPEAKER_01:** Were you watching a variety of Bitcoin conference talks? Was that a sort of a regular thing that you were doing at that point, watching YouTube?

**[04:36] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, at the time I was very, very interested and very much into these things. I mean, you know, I was hoping that, you know, changes related to this kind of technologies would come a lot earlier. I was already careful. I was sold in the hype a bit, or contributed to it myself in a way.

**[04:55] SPEAKER_01:** Had you been sort of following along with things like MasterCoin and Colored Coins and other sort of Bitcoin 2.0 projects?

**[05:01] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, actually I did, yeah. kind of a i think it would be chairs at the point i'm sorry and there was big chairs i think oh yeah yeah yeah and there was this kind of and then open transactions which uh very close to kind of gavin's heart i think worked with together and um yeah i don't know what came after that after all but interesting and then so after i left the bcc and uh and uh running that um winter she spent in Thailand half in the retreat and then in my spare time I was working on the yellow paper and with my way through the really hard notation and getting put in the paper yes a lot of people struggled with that sort of math heavy notation and

**[05:50] SPEAKER_01:** And so you went to Gav's presentation, which would have been very early February. So, that was only like a week or so after Vitalik's presentation in Miami. It would have been very, very close. So you spoke to Gav there and then you exchanged emails, did you?

**[06:04] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, basically, we changed emails. He put me on Skype group. There was a Skype group at the time. I think it was 20-odd people on it, really. So not a big crowd. And yeah, that's how it all started. So very nice in the beginning to discover really grandiose ideas and chat and be part of it. I'm super proud and very happy that I managed to be at the year nearly it's kind of a lucky move to be honest so was it a fair bit later in that year um that you started working uh with with danny on swarm were you doing
