**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** So, hello, I am Bob Summerwill and this is Early Days of Ethereum with my good friend Viktor Trón. So, hi Viktor, how are you?

**[00:08] SPEAKER_01:** Very, very well, thank you. Hello, Bob. Thank you for inviting me to the show. It's wonderful to reminisce.

**[00:16] SPEAKER_00:** Well, great to have you here. So, yeah, we bumped into each other in Buenos Aires for DevConnect and had hoped to record there, but for one reason or another, that never happened. So good to connect you online instead. So talking about the early days of Ethereum, you were very early in Ethereum. So I mean, what were you doing in your life prior to that that led you to the project?

**[00:41] SPEAKER_01:** Work wise? I was not exactly, I wouldn't say I was exactly very close to the crypto scene to be honest. I was working on a project with BBC News Labs, the News Juicer project, which was trying to ingest a lot of news sources like from old photo archives, video archives, and everything, and use speech recognition to categorize it and make it searchable in a very nice way. Of course, it's one of those BBC-sponsored projects no one really needed, and it was never really used, but it was a nice project to work on. Anyway, I left the job.

**[01:35] SPEAKER_00:** At that time, you were in London, you were living in London?

**[01:38] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I was in London. I was living in London, and I left the job because I found Ethereum. I was very excited right away. So when Gavin visited this kind of web new web meetup, some sort of new web meetup, and presented Ethereum, I was absolutely taken back and found it amazing and a game changer. What led me to it, to be honest, was I was already quite into Bitcoin, which is interesting because Bitcoin came into my life through a friend who I knew from an anarchist club or Facebook group. He introduced me to it on ideological grounds, but of course, I was very interested in tech as well. It took me quite a while to understand what blockchain is, how all these things come together, but by that time, I had a solid understanding of blockchain so that I could question Gavin and Vitalik and say it's absolutely not going to work because of this haunting problem. Bit by bit, when I understood that they had answers to every question I could think of, I got to admit that they are probably the geniuses I really want to look up to and have in my environment to learn from. It was a very great start. So when Gavin presented Ethereum, the next day I was already hacking on the C++ code base, and my first PR was submitted. We met in a cafe in Dalston, I think. I remember those were quite impressive times. I learned that having used Mac but actually running Linux on it was very impressive.

**[04:07] SPEAKER_00:** And you mentioned your anarchist group there. So had Bitcoin earlier been interesting to you from that kind of monetary, anarchist, libertarian perspective?

**[04:17] SPEAKER_01:** When Bitcoin came, it was the time when I even learned what money really was. Before, I didn't even grasp this notion. It was a very important time in my life. It was really a game changer to have a framework in which I could totally identify myself with freedom-seeking individualism. I really liked the Austrian view of the economy and finally understood how money was used and what inflation was. I had never really understood that before. I came late to the game, let's say that. But yeah, it was all very history after that.

**[05:17] SPEAKER_00:** The next web meeting that you mentioned, was that like a recurring meetup that you were going to or were you regularly going to web meetups?

**[05:27] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, but this one particularly stood out because I saw Vitalik's presentation in Miami, and that got me interested. So I knew what I was in for when I showed up at that meeting in Houston Square, I think it was.

**[05:47] SPEAKER_00:** Sorry, you said Vitalik's presentation, was that the one he gave in Miami?

**[05:52] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, exactly. So I knew what to expect, but of course, I never really understood it fully until Gavin helped me understand it. It was really great.

**[06:07] SPEAKER_00:** Were you watching a variety of Bitcoin conference talks? Was that a regular thing you were doing at that point?

**[06:16] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, watching YouTube, yes. I was very interested in these things. I was hoping that changes related to these technologies would come much earlier. I was already contributing to the hype myself in a way.

**[06:38] SPEAKER_00:** Had you been following along with things like Mastercoin, Colored Coins, and other Bitcoin 2.0 projects?

**[06:46] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, actually, I did. It was kind of a thing. I think it was Bitshares, and then there was Open Transactions, which was very close to Gavin's heart, I think. He worked together with them on that.

**[07:05] SPEAKER_00:** Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[07:06] SPEAKER_01:** I don't know what came out on that afternoon, but it was interesting. After I left BBC, I spent that winter in Thailand, half in a retreat, and in my spare time, I was working on the Yellow Paper and worked my way through the really hard notation that Gavin had put on paper.

**[07:39] SPEAKER_00:** A lot of people struggled with that sort of math-heavy notation. So you went to Gav's presentation, which would have been very early February. That was only like a week or so after Vitalik's presentation in Miami. It would have been very close.

**[07:59] SPEAKER_01:** Correct.

**[08:00] SPEAKER_00:** So you spoke to Gav there and then you exchanged emails, did you?

**[08:06] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, we exchanged emails. He put me on a Skype group. There was a Skype group at the time with about 20 odd people on it. Really not a big crowd. That's how it all started. Very nice in the beginning with these grandiose ideas and chats. I'm super proud and very happy that I managed to be at the forefront of it. It's kind of a lucky move to be honest.

**[08:37] SPEAKER_00:** So was it a fair bit later in that year that you started working with Danny on Swarm?

**[08:45] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, it came a little bit later. So first, in the spring, I started working on the Yellow Paper and then a bit on the C++ code base. Not a lot. Then, I think it was in March or sometime that I showed up at the first Ethereum meetup. Maybe not the first, but the second one in London.

**[09:15] SPEAKER_00:** This was organized by Stefan Tual?

**[09:17] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes, yes. There was Mihai there who later became part of Swarm. I talked to Jack du Rose quite a lot, who later worked at Colony.

**[09:35] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, of Colony fame, exactly.

**[09:38] SPEAKER_01:** And that's when I met Jeff first. So Jeff became my boss later.

**[09:43] SPEAKER_00:** He came to London for that meetup?

**[09:45] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, he did.

**[09:46] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[09:47] SPEAKER_01:** That's when I saw that it's quite an international crowd from all over the world doing this thing. So I started taking it very seriously. I left my job and started contributing to the Go code base. I was really into Golang. That's where I contributed most and became part of the Geth team after Jeff offered me the job around September or October that year when the foundation was already actively paying salaries and recruiting people.

**[10:32] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, so I was looking at the timing on that. The Ethereum Foundation was founded in July 2014, and then the crowd sale was going through July, August, September. Then the hiring, that first wave of having money to hire people, was around September, October.

**[10:52] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, I was negotiating it with Aeron Buchanan, I remember. And I'm not sure when the Amsterdam office in Wurstraat was funded, but I visited Jeff later that year there. When I first joined, I was talking to my friends in Hungary, some of whom were related to this Facebook group, including Dani Feher and another person who was very close to Swarm but never officially entered the scene. So there was some thinking that maybe the four of us could form a group and join as a sub-dev team or something, but it never happened. So we were hired individually. Then around that later that year, there was DEFCON 0, correct?

**[12:06] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah. Just popping back a little bit, through 2014, prior to the sale and so on, how were things working early in 2014? You mentioned a Skype group. Were most people working through Skype?

**[12:21] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, yes, mainly everything was done by Gavin, Jeff, and Vitalik. The rest of us were just contributors at that time. I'm talking about the technical stuff. I'm not sure about the admin and foundation stuff, but for the tech, it was mainly Skype. I think it was in July that Jeff shared a Go-Ethereum codebase with me and introduced me to the intricacies of the developing peer-to-peer protocol. That was my first project. It was the latest scraped codebase that Felix and the other guys were working on, but that was my first attempt at working on the networking layer at the time. I was trying to pitch some crazy ideas to Jeff about developer tooling, contract verification, staging, and fake blockchain environments. He was adamant that there were other things to do, and he was focusing on end-user applications like Mist browser. He was trying to talk me out of it and said the C++ team was assigned to that anyway, so I shouldn't tread unwanted paths. He brought me back to focus on Go-Ethereum.

**[14:24] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, he had Aleph Zero, right? Aleph Zero was an earlier incarnation of that.

**[14:30] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that's correct. But there were also not so glorious tasks like refactoring logging and things like that I remember in the early days. There was also a time when I was learning Go because it was not a super popular language at the time, so there was a lot of learning to do.

**[14:58] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, Go was relatively new at that point. You mentioned the Yellow Paper. In those early months of 2014, Gav in particular seemed incredibly productive in terms of what he was getting through with the C++ client and the Yellow Paper. Was the code leading, and then the Yellow Paper was modeled after that?

**[15:24] SPEAKER_01:** It's hard for me to say if they were developing hand in hand. Maybe it's better for Gavin to answer that. But yes, the productivity and speed at which he was churning out C++ code was absolutely stunning. Within a few months, some of these clients already worked. Jeff was also incredible in his productivity. These people were really great examples to learn from.

**[15:58] SPEAKER_00:** I think that triangulation was so important—having multiple clients and the spec, and the Python client, though not to production status. Those three groups all working together were crucial.

**[16:13] SPEAKER_01:** Ethereum was always very proud of multi-client development leading to very solid specs. It's actually true, but the reason was that these brilliant individuals just followed their favorite languages and wanted to build their own clients. Ultimately, what came out of it was amazing. The specification was very solid. I remember just a few times when the specification had to be changed. There was a case with a modular operation that wasn't exactly minus, I think. There was another issue around Easter 2015 where two uncles had the same timestamp, which led to a fork. I wrote up a blog post about it but never published it.

**[17:32] SPEAKER_00:** Talking to Jakob Choplick, he was an intern at the Berlin office in 2015. He told me about a hard fork that happened on the mainnet around two weeks after launching, which I was unaware of. Looking back, there was a security announcement by Jutta, a patching of the Geth client. While I was running old clients, I saw that if you run Geth 1.00 or 1.01, it gets stuck and can't go through Frontier blocks. So it was actually a hard fork.

**[18:17] SPEAKER_01:** Do you remember what it was related to?

**[18:19] SPEAKER_00:** I think it was some kind of gas counting bug or something. It was a hard fork but never given a name because it was just an accident.

**[18:35] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, sure. You wonder how many more of these little things happened that are forgotten in the mists of time. Yes, so through early 2014, you were working initially on the C++ client and later on the Go client. How many people were working on Go in 2014?

**[19:00] SPEAKER_01:** It was really just a few people around. Jeff was mainly the designer, and Alex van de Sande from Brazil was also working on it. I think I was either the second team member or the first official one.

**[19:23] SPEAKER_00:** You were the second team member, right?

**[19:25] SPEAKER_01:** Correct, just about. Or maybe the first paid one, I'm not sure. We came roughly at the same time with Alex and Felix, I think.

**[19:42] SPEAKER_00:** Right, yeah. In terms of when you started, were there other people working on Go Ethereum ahead of your joining?

**[19:49] SPEAKER_01:** Not really. Jeff was pretty much the only one at that time contributing code. There was quite a vibrant ecosystem of people around like Slock.it and Nick Savers. We went to the Bitcoin conference together, I think in April.

**[20:17] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, you went to Toronto?

**[20:19] SPEAKER_01:** No, it was Amsterdam.

**[20:21] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, okay.

**[20:22] SPEAKER_01:** That's when I had the chance to talk to Vitalik quite a bit. It was very nice. Nick Savers was around a lot early but never officially joined the Ethereum Foundation. He was employed by some bank.

**[20:45] SPEAKER_00:** But I saw he and some others did the first continuous integration build system, and he worked on the Java client as well.

**[20:53] SPEAKER_01:** That's true. The Java client was mainly led by Roman Mandeleev, who mysteriously disappeared after Ether Camp.

**[21:07] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, Ether Camp.

**[21:08] SPEAKER_01:** That's correct. Thanks for reminding us. Well, nostalgia, all these phrases.

**[21:15] SPEAKER_00:** Early 2017, Roman disappeared. They did Hack a Gold, a hackathon with some controversy about buying votes, but they were paid out anyway. People thought he exit scammed, but I'm not convinced because if he did, it was the worst exit scam ever because it was so early, and nobody had significant amounts of money at that point.

**[21:49] SPEAKER_01:** He's definitely an enabled and committed guy.

**[21:52] SPEAKER_00:** So maybe he didn't scam. You mentioned EtherSphere, so that's EtherSphere.

**[21:58] SPEAKER_01:** It was wishful thinking that it might be EtherSphere, but I did register it as an organization on GitHub. I think it was one of the first Ethereum-related brands, along with Aryan Industries.

**[22:18] SPEAKER_00:** Right, yeah, Ari.

**[22:20] SPEAKER_01:** Who later became Monax. EtherSphere was the home of most of our work, and we committed through that to the Ethereum codebase.

**[22:32] SPEAKER_00:** So that was yourself, Daniel Feher, and later George Pfeffer, who worked on the light client, I think in 2015.

**[22:43] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, George Pfeffer was hired to work on the light client in 2015. He wasn't at DEFCON 0, but DEFCON 0 was when Danny and I started working on Swarm.

**[23:00] SPEAKER_00:** So maybe you could say a bit about Swarm. My understanding is that some of the ideas went a long way back.

**[23:07] SPEAKER_01:** In May 2014, there was a seminal triad of talks in Whitechapel. In that talk, web3 was first introduced in the Ethereum context, explaining how decentralization could extend to support the entire web. If you extend it to data, app data, hosting, and messaging, you can conceive of it as the world computer with Ethereum blockchain as the CPU, Swarm as storage, and Whisper as messaging. That's when Swarm was born.

**[23:53] SPEAKER_00:** You mentioned Whitechapel. Was that some meetups happening there?

**[23:57] SPEAKER_01:** Ethereum had a co-working space in Whitechapel. Vitalik was often found there, so it became a focal point for internal meetings.

**[24:12] SPEAKER_00:** Would that have been when the famous diagram with the circle and apps coming in at the side first surfaced?

**[24:20] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, that was just about that time. It included QML and QT as anticipated tech platforms, not just HTML.

**[24:32] SPEAKER_00:** That's when web3 was born, right?

**[24:34] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, that's when web3 was born. Vitalik had this gimmick of Thorn (£), which is also Icelandic lettering.

**[24:45] SPEAKER_00:** Oh yeah, the thorn.

**[24:46] SPEAKER_01:** Yes. That's when Whisper was invented. Vitalik's gimmicks.

**[24:51] SPEAKER_00:** Ethereum was just one of many related protocols.

**[24:55] SPEAKER_01:** And that's why I was very dedicated to Ethereum. I understood what it means to have Turing-complete computation secured on its own blockchain. They envisioned a significant change in how the Internet works with Swarm, Whisper, and all these things. I quite liked the idea. Later, I learned that some of us, like Danny, who operated a DC node, had legal troubles, which brought him directly into implementing Swarm, the idea of decentralized storage and incentivization.

**[25:43] SPEAKER_00:** Zolt mentioned that the idea for Swarm went back to at least 2011.

**[25:49] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, it was mainly Danny's idea. He saw the qualities of BitTorrent but also its drawbacks. BitTorrent had difficulty starting downloads, throttling rules, and lacked proper incentives to keep data. Also, individual bits of the file weren't addressable directly—you needed a tracker to resolve them. Danny's idea was to chunk things so every chunk was content-addressable, and placement of chunks was part of the DHT (Distributed Hash Table). Normally, a DHT puts node IDs and content IDs in the same space, and you get information about who to download chunks from. But this isn't very private or deniable. Swarm aimed to enforce an orange layer on top, making it harder to deny knowledge of specific chunks. Danny's idea of storing pre-images in the DHT was called DPA (Distributed Pre-image Archive), which became very important in Swarm.

**[27:40] SPEAKER_00:** I didn't know that BitTorrent users in Germany faced legal prosecution.

**[27:45] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, much later, but Danny was trying to solve this with Swarm. We implemented chunking and DHT in Swarm, using TCP instead of UDP for networking because TCP was easier to implement with DevP2P. We suggested keeping permanent connections with peers and using Kademlia over live connections, forwarding requests backward. This allowed peer-to-peer accounting to work, gave Swarm its privacy features, and solved opportunistic caching problems. Retrieval paths could remember chunks automatically, distributing popular content. Swarm's first public pilot was released in December 2016.

**[29:29] SPEAKER_00:** Let's take a step back. The primary idea with Swarm was that you could have the holy trinity of decentralized compute (blockchain), decentralized storage (Swarm), and decentralized messaging (Whisper). This synergy could solve the primary issue of hosting the web front end for decentralized applications. You need smart contracts and transactions, but you also need an application wrapper. The idea was to have a decentralized storage mechanism that could store HTML and JavaScript, with an incentive system to keep content available and avoid the tragedy of the commons. Ethereum's cryptocurrency and smart contract system allowed implementing these incentives, creating an unstoppable holistic system. Even now, a lot of applications depend on centralized services, which is very centralized.

**[31:07] SPEAKER_01:** I'm pretty sad about this. For example, Bitfinex was hacked because of a safe hack. If they had used Swarm, it would have been much harder to change transactions under the hood because they had to upload something through S3. This is harder to do with content addressing. You start from the blockchain as the single source of truth, resolve ENS names to content hashes, and retrieve content hashes from decentralized stores. ENS was coming to life in 2016 as well.

**[32:09] SPEAKER_00:** Nick Johnson was part of the Swarm team?

**[32:11] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, Nick Johnson was first part of the Swarm team. He developed ENS and later took off.

**[32:17] SPEAKER_00:** I didn't know he worked on Swarm. I knew he was part of the Geth team.

**[32:21] SPEAKER_01:** Definitely, yes. I recruited him.

**[32:24] SPEAKER_00:** Did you know him in London?

**[32:26] SPEAKER_01:** No, he was just part of the community. He made valuable contributions.

**[32:31] SPEAKER_00:** Let me check the timeline. Nick Johnson was hired in June 2016, same as Hudson Jameson.

**[32:43] SPEAKER_01:** Yes.

**[32:45] SPEAKER_00:** You talked about DEFCON 0 in November 2014 in Berlin. Was that the first time you met Alex Leverington?

**[32:55] SPEAKER_01:** Yes, that was a special memory. We had lots of discussions. He was very knowledgeable but also stubborn with his way of thinking about the protocol. I was trying to learn from him while being pragmatic and simplifying things.

**[33:19] SPEAKER_00:** LibP2P as part of Protocol Labs and IPFS already existed at that time. There was this whole DevP2P vs. LibP2P thing.

**[33:30] SPEAKER_01:** Ethereum suffered from not-invented-here syndrome. We had our own serialization protocol, RLP, and DevP2P. Looking back, using LibP2P from the start might have been better. DevP2P got stuck in execution clients forever, while consensus clients switched to LibP2P.

**[34:17] SPEAKER_00:** DEFCON 0 was in November 2014. Things continued through 2015 up to mainnet launch. You mentioned DEFCON 0 in November 2014. What are your memories of that event?

**[34:33] SPEAKER_01:** It was a very successful presentation of Swarm. There was a lot of interest at the time.

**[34:40] SPEAKER_00:** Looking back at DEFCON 1 videos, I see so many ideas were presented by that point. Nearly anything you could think of in all areas, someone was working on it. There was a real flourishing of people building on Ethereum.

**[35:03] SPEAKER_01:** We thought decentralized services like decentralized eBay, Uber, Airbnb would come much earlier, but it took time. Swarm didn't realize its potential until much later.

**[35:26] SPEAKER_00:** Where is Swarm now in 2023? What's happening? How's the functionality?

**[35:32] SPEAKER_01:** We have a solid network with a consolidated definition of the protocol. Swarm is a DPA (Distributed Pre-image Archive), a distributed chunk store where nodes distribute chunks with strong privacy properties. We have implemented manifests for key-value storage and directories, erasure codes for redundancy, and ACT (Access Control Mechanism) for encryption keys. Swarm handles mutability with feeds, similar to sub-block ENS, where chunks are signed for integrity. This allows handling mutable content like databases.

**[37:14] SPEAKER_00:** How does Swarm compare to IPFS + Filecoin, Arweave, and others?

**[37:21] SPEAKER_01:** IPFS is widely used but lacks privacy features and incentives. Filecoin is good for archival with strong availability proofs but suffers from slow retrieval. Swarm is different with automatic postage stamp incentives and privacy features. We take monetary incentives seriously, with clients modeled as rational profit-maximizing agents. Incentive design is crucial in Ethereum, with smart contracts expressing self-enforcing contracts and beautiful incentive systems.

**[39:53] SPEAKER_00:** Looking back over these 10 years, has Ethereum become what you thought it would be at the start? What are your reflections on this journey?

**[40:02] SPEAKER_01:** Ethereum is still very close to my heart. It fulfills many of its early promises, though some mature slower than expected. Proof of Stake took longer than anticipated. Swarm's promise of decentralized apps didn't fully materialize yet. We still suffer from centralized dependencies like Infura. Moxi Marlinspike mocked NFTs on OpenSea by showing how they can turn into third-party images. Instead of lamenting, I stay optimistic about the tech and its unstoppable future. Unstoppability is unstoppable now, and I hope people understand it without stupid regulations curbing its use.

**[42:38] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, well, thanks so much, and all the very best.

**[42:42] SPEAKER_01:** Okay, thank you very much, Bob. It was lovely to talk to you and reminisce about the past.

**[42:50] SPEAKER_00:** You too. Thanks so much. Bye. Bye.
