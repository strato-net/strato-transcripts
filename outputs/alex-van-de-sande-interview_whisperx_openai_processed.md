**SPEAKER_02 (Alex):**
What's going on, everybody?
Alex, I sent you an invite to speak and co-host. If you have any questions, just let me know. You can DM me.

Good to see the faces piling in. Got a lot of good questions here. Can't wait to talk about just the rich history here.

Here—there we go. Alex, good to have you here, man. Appreciate it.

If anybody else wants to come up later and ask any questions, just feel free to raise your hand.

Kind of... kind of a bit under-watery. Huh, is Victor out here? No? Victor? Okay, let me see.

Give us a few moments, guys. We're trying to set this up. Appreciate your patience.

Ah, technology... Cartoons, you want to come up? I'll invite you, even if you're just on the panel. You don't got to speak. You were here for Episode Zero, so how about you?

Got you, Mac. I wish that my phone wasn't so dumb. I'll DJ some stuff here instead of this silence.

**SPEAKER_06 (Alex Van De Sande):**
You should sing, AG.

**SPEAKER_02 (Alex):**
Who said that? Alex?

**SPEAKER_06 (Alex Van De Sande):**
Hey. You should play some live music.

**SPEAKER_03:**
I was playing some classical music, but yeah, I don't know. It's good to have you on here.

I'm glad the mic's all working out now. I really appreciate you jumping on. It's been an interesting six months for sure.

Yeah, so really, I just want to kind of just pick your brain a bit about the past—honestly, like, more than just, you know, MistCoin in general, but really just like how you got all started with, you know, the Ethereum Foundation and whatnot.

So, like, when did you actually hear about Ethereum, and what was your kind of first initial reaction to it?

**SPEAKER_06 (Alex Van De Sande):**
Sure.

I have to say, my wife thinks it's hilarious that... I'm old enough that my early work is being discovered by archaeologists now. So I find it funny, a little bit weird, but it's fun.

I think I started being interested in Bitcoin around 2012. And it feels like a long time ago—feels like the early days. But for me, I already felt like, "Oh God, I missed it."

They were already talking about Bitcoin on *The Good Wife* on live TV. I'm like, "Oh no, but it used to be under a dollar. Now it's like $10. Damn, I so missed Bitcoin, right? That's too bad."

I even remember I posted something on the forum saying, "Oh no, I tried buying Bitcoin at $5. It was so hard."

And then someone—simply, I think—tipped me like five Bitcoin on Reddit saying, "Hey, here's your $5 worth of Bitcoin." And back then, I dunno, probably a full Bitcoin, right? Bitcoin was $5 back then.

So that was those early days. Again, it didn't feel too early, and then I started paying attention because I felt that I knew something bigger would come of Bitcoin. I just started following all sorts of projects like Colored Coins, MasterCoin, things like that until I found Ethereum.

I was so blown away and captivated that I couldn't think of anything else.

People were still very active on Reddit. Vitalik [Buterin] would answer questions personally. Then I just started helping out on the forum, on Reddit.

I'm a designer; I'm not a coder, so I thought, "Hey, there are enough coders here—maybe the designer can help." And then someone would ask for something for a presentation—I could give them that.

By the time the presale rolled around, they started having cash, hiring people, and I was on the list. So that's how I got... I started working with some crazy people.

**SPEAKER_03:**
So you did not expect to be so heavily involved and become the pioneer that you did. You were just kind of...

**SPEAKER_06 (Alex Van De Sande):**
...jumping in and, you know, interested in this new opportunity, really. You didn't expect it to blow up like this?

I certainly didn't expect it to. Like, sort of... yes and no, because I felt that back then it seemed very obvious that it was going to be a big thing.

I was like, "I'm amazed that nobody else is paying attention to this."

I felt like telling everybody I knew, "Can't you see? Look at this shit. This is crazy. It's like a blockchain with a computer inside!"

And people were acting as if it was crazy.

I was a founder of a company back then. I was doing an iPhone app. It was sort of an Instagram for professionals, and I had raised money. The app wasn't going anywhere.

And I realized that I wasn't using any of my spare brain cells to think about my iPhone app. I was just thinking about Ethereum all the time.

And then I told my friends I wanted to leave this. They were like, "Are you leaving the app you founded to work for a 19-year-old? They're going to pay you in, like, made-up money that he invented?"

I was like, "Yeah, sure. That seems like a great idea."

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah, that's crazy, man. That's honestly the—I mean, just your... your belief in what this could turn out to be ended up leading you to such success and being a pioneer in this space.

So when we talked before in the past, you told me you kind of helped assemble the Mist Wallet development team. You explained you were part of the hiring and you brought Fabian Vogelsteller on board.

How did you go about getting in touch with or finding Fabian to add to the team? And what made you so confident in his abilities?

**SPEAKER_06 (Alex Van De Sande):**
So when I started working, the first person I started talking about working with was Gavin Wood.

Gavin was the one who sort of introduced me to the idea of making a browser.

[CONTINUED...]

Would you like me to complete the remaining part of the transcript?

```plaintext
SPEAKER_03:**
There was nothing you could tokenize.
So we basically released two tokens. One came with the wallet and was the unicorn thing. Whenever you donated to the foundation, you got a unicorn. And the other that we wanted people to be able to play with for free was just like something that Fabian Vogelsteller created—literally for fun—just using the standard thing they had.

Then we just started giving it away on Reddit for people to try it out. Like, nobody gave a lot of thought about it; it was just, "This is the best thing that we want to try out, and we want people to play around with it."

Of course. Yeah, no, I get it. And in regard to the unicorn, the Unicorn token was like...

**SPEAKER_06:**
Five, six months later, though, right?

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah. I mean, based on the contracts, I don't know if it was—it wasn't talked about internally—but not released until later. But yeah, it was released in 2016, a couple of months later. I think it was two or three months ago. And I think unicorns are great too, but I mean, I can't—they're very hard to get a hold of. So, yeah.

**SPEAKER_06:**
I mean, as you say, like, trust the timestamp, right? If you were asking me, I wouldn't swear that we released both of them at the same time when we released the tokens on the wallet. Maybe we hadn't, like—

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah, I don't think you did. But the thing is, that Unicorn is actually like an ERC-20—quote-unquote—actually an ERC-20, because Mist is basically an ERC-20 besides the `approve` function. So it was like, that's why if you go look at the Unicorns...

I'm pretty sure they have all of the ERC-20 standard implemented, whereas Mist is basically a skeleton for it. It's just missing a few parts, or one part, and then it would be considered a full ERC-20. But Fabian considers it. I think you had a good outlook on exactly how it met the standard besides the `approve` function.

But yeah, that's super, super interesting. I was going to say, was there anyone else that kind of helped in—whether it be just ideating or actually getting in there and coding—because I know you said you weren't really a coder, that kind of helped with figuring out this ERC-20 standard? Or was it really just Fabian? I know you mentioned Gavin Wood. I didn't know if he was kind of in the coding side of things too, or was it really just Fabian when it comes to the actual coding part of it?

**SPEAKER_06:**
Well, we had a lot of feedback from the community in regards to how to build the tokens. There were some projects. I think the guys from MakerDAO—I think Rune Christensen was already participating on that. Rune from MakerDAO was already saying, "Look, we have this project. We already released a big number of tokens."

They were talking about other tokens they were working on for that project. Of course, there was no standard for that, and that’s sort of why we wanted—yeah, sure, you release a token, but that doesn't mean anything. We need a standard so that everyone could release tokens, and those tokens could exist on wallets and things like that.

So Fabian basically got the feedback from the whole community, wrote the standard, and those things were very—it was a very participatory project, right? Writing a standard is, by its design, something where you want to have the buy-in of the community. You want to have a lot of feedback so that everyone can, at some point, just agree on something, right?

It's not something where you just come out and say, "Hey, this is how the foundation is going to do it." No, you want to hear it and you want to make sure that everyone is following the standard. Otherwise, it won’t be a standard; it’ll just be a proprietary format.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Hmm. Yeah, that kind of leads me into my next question. Did you believe ERC-20 would kind of achieve this relevance and be as big as it is here 10 years later? Or did you expect a better or newer standard to come around?

**SPEAKER_06:**
We knew the tokens were super important for Ethereum, right? Back when we were working on the Mist wallet, basically all other crypto wallets had one function in mind, which was: you get the wallet, you get your Ether from the pre-sale, and you send it to an exchange to sell it. Or you just bought something on an exchange, and you sent it to yourself.

That was the only reason anyone would use a wallet. There were already a lot of other wallets back then. And all of them were just that—it was just a way for you to get your Ether back and sell it.

And we really wanted to fix that. We knew that if we wanted people to use Ethereum the way we envisioned, we needed to create those functions. We needed to invent new cool stuff that people wanted to use. That’s why it was really important for us to start working on tokens.

Like, did you expect the ERC-20? Here’s something funny that I didn’t expect. We really expected tokens themselves to be big. I did not expect the term "ERC-20" to be so big, right? To the point that Bitcoin tokens are now known as BRC-20, which is laughable because the "20" doesn’t mean anything!

"20" was just a random number—it just happened to be the number Fabian gave to the proposal. And suddenly BRC-20 becomes a thing.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah, I mean, that’s imitation—it’s the sincerest form of flattery. Even though those BRC-20s don’t even have smart contracts or anything like that. It’s a totally different kind of tech. It just pays homage to the fact of how important the ERC-20 was to the development of the tech.

You’re a pioneer. I mean, you, Fabian, everyone that was part of this. You guys created something. Even though the Mist wallet was sunsetted at some point, the mark you guys left on cryptocurrency and blockchain is honestly huge. And it’s crazy that you weren’t even really expecting it to have that much...

**SPEAKER_06:**
Let me say this because you keep calling me a pioneer and all. Here's the thing: Whenever you get a new community, it’s usually very small. When I started working on Ethereum, there were probably less than 100 people actively working on anything Ethereum. So naturally, anything you build becomes significant if the ecosystem grows.

But those ripples only matter because the project grew. The project grows due to thousands of factors. If someone looks back and says, "Wow, you guys were pioneers," I think the focus is more on just getting involved in the right projects that grow big, rather than any innate 'pioneering' feature. Those opportunities are always out there.

**SPEAKER_03:**
No, yeah, I agree. It’s just about building, really—building something you're passionate about. But regardless of how you see it, a lot of people still consider you a pioneer. So maybe you didn’t start with that mindset, but it’s what you became while you were in there building and doing cool stuff.

Certainly! Below is the corrected version of your Ethereum and blockchain-related transcript, adhering to the specified guidelines.

**SPEAKER_03:**
A full node on Swarm, and every app there would be hosted on Swarm. We didn't even want it to allow you to connect to a traditional web, as you would call it. We didn't even want you to be able to connect to our website.

The idea was that every app that you load—if you load an ENS name—that is going to connect to a Swarm node. And that is going to get you to download your app directly from other Mist wallet users, right? And also, you'll be running an Ethereum full node so that you're never dependent on anything, right?

I mean, we were, let’s say, not very pragmatic about it because the reality was that it worked for a few years in 2014, 2015, and 2016, right? It wasn't still possible for you to run a full node on your desktop. But the reality is that by 2017, when one of the first really big major full runs started happening, it would already take hours and hours to download everything and actually have the wallet working.

Most people had already migrated by then to Metamask, which is just instant, right? You download it. You don’t need to download a new browser. You already use the browser you like. It connects directly to Etherscan, so you don’t need to worry about a full node. It connects directly to the web, so you don’t need to worry about storing your web page or anything like that.

And in the end, that, I think, was one of the main reasons that Mist failed. Because we were sort of giving too much in a way—we wanted everyone to run a full node. We wanted everyone to run a fully decentralized web, and that wasn’t possible back then. Honestly, it’s still not possible today. That is how the whole project ended up with no users. We had to shut it down, and that was one of the main reasons.

---

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah, that was one of my questions toward the end. I was going to ask why you guys actually decided to sunset, but that makes sense because it is hard to get people to interact on that level. You have to create a node and make sure the node is running correctly and everything. That just kind of steers some of the less technical people away.

---

**SPEAKER_06 (Alex Van de Sande):**
We were able to abstract a lot of that technical side of creating a node. You didn’t know you were creating a node. You didn’t know you were creating anything like that. You were just uploading.

But the problem with trying to abstract a lot of things in design is that you can make a lot of things feel like magic—that’s what we wanted to do. But there’s a point in which you hit a technical roadblock.

For most users, that roadblock was when we would tell them, "Look, it’s going to take you five hours, six hours, or maybe a full week before you can even use this app," right? And there’s no way to abstract anything about that.

I remember spending hours and hours trying to work on the right load animation to make sure that the little bar would feel like it was loading faster than it was actually loading. But then, there’s no design that can save you when the amount of time it’s going to actually take is, like, a week, right? The animation can look fancy and have a lot of cute things, but it’s still going to take a week. There’s no way around that. There’s no "putting lipstick on that pig," as they say.

---

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah, I think Mac was talking about that earlier in the space. Mac, you can come up and say something if your mic sounds all right.

---

**SPEAKER_02:**
No, no, not going to say anything? Okay, sounds good. I’ll go to my next question.

---

**SPEAKER_01:**
I got a question to ask.

---

**SPEAKER_02:**
Oh, okay. Yeah, go ahead, brother.

---

**SPEAKER_01 (Magician/Mud):**
Yeah. How’s everybody doing?

---

**SPEAKER_02:**
Good, good, good. Glad to have you up here.

---

**SPEAKER_01 (Magician/Mud):**
You know me as Magician, but you guys can just call me Mud. I have a question for Alex.

I was going to ask—you actually answered another question I posted in the Telegram—which was, what was your biggest concern as far as the development side of onboarding the next billion users?

And I think you kind of touched on it. You said account abstraction, if I’m not mistaken. Another question I wanted to ask was, what’s your biggest lesson that you’ve learned on a personal level? Specifically, in terms of finding that balance between putting your head down and pushing forward your ideas, and working with a team.

What’s your biggest lesson when it comes to trying to push forward an idea you believe in, while also being receptive to other people’s ideas and finding a way to make others see your vision?

---

**SPEAKER_06 (Alex Van de Sande):**
That is a great question!

How we work as a team, right? I think the best work I’ve ever done was… well, I’ve been working with remote teams for over 10 years, right? Way before Zoom was a thing and way before COVID was a thing, we were remote teams—not because we wanted to be, but because there was no other way to get people from all over the world to work on a single project if you had to fly everyone to the same place, right?

We had to work remotely.

Here’s your refined transcript adhering to the outlined guidelines:**

**Alex Van De Sande:**
And he just figured out a way to, like, he's been studying computer science history, and he found a way to create virtual computers that are much more parallel. They can execute faster and do a lot of things like that. And I think it is fantastic. It's one of those things that is very hard to communicate what they are doing, but I think they are doing something that is going to be big, which is why I like working with them. Part of what I work on there is just trying to explain to people what they are doing.

And we are working on a new website. It's going to be very cool. You're going to be able to see some animations. But in essence, we are all using Turing Machines. And he's like, look, Turing Machines are wrong. There are better ways to do it. Instead of having this concept of a Turing Machine, which is like a little robot with an infinite tape that goes back and forth and changes the tapes from zero to one, he's able to turn any sort of computation into basically a planar graph with a thousand lines. And those lines have four little commands they can do.

They can do it all at the same time. So you can run it on 16 cores at the same time. It just becomes a very easy way to transform any computation into something that is multi-core all the time. So yeah, if you think this sounds interesting, you should definitely follow the HVM page.

---

**SPEAKER_03:**
How do I profit? How do I invest in this?

---

**Alex Van De Sande:**
Well, you should follow us. If you want to be a pioneer yourself, maybe you can participate in some way, right?

---

**SPEAKER_03:**
I would like to be a pioneer like you, Alex. I really would. Is that the High Order Company, or is that something else?

---

**Alex Van De Sande:**
Yeah, definitely.

---

**SPEAKER_03:**
Okay, I'm definitely going to check that out and do some research on it because that sounds amazing. It sounds like the guy you’ve got on board is definitely one of those genius pioneers that you don't come across very often.

---

**Alex Van De Sande:**
Yeah, you should definitely follow him.

---

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah, I'm going to look into that. I wholeheartedly really appreciate you, Alex, jumping on here. Maybe we could do it again sometime because I still have like 20 other questions I want to ask you. And I know there are other people here too that wanted to come up, but it's been about an hour, and I don't want to take too much of your time. So thank you so much. I really, truly do appreciate it.

---

**Alex Van De Sande:**
Well, thank you for the invitation. It was fun to have this conversation.

---

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah, man. Have a good day. We'll probably stay on for a little bit and chat it up, so you're more than welcome to head out and do whatever you’ve got to do. Thanks, man.

---

**Alex Van De Sande:**
Thank you, everyone. Have a good one. Bye.

---

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, that's great. That was great. How much longer are you going to stay on?

---

**SPEAKER_03:**
I don't know. I was just kind of letting him dip out to see what everybody thought. I thought that was really super informative.

---

**SPEAKER_01:**
Hey, nice job, bro. Yeah, you really held it down. Good job.

---

**SPEAKER_03:**
I mean, I had a whole list of stuff I wanted to make sure I asked him, and I only got through like half of it. I would have stayed out here for another hour, but I appreciate it. Yeah, nonetheless, bro. Nonetheless.

---

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, no, yeah, that was really good. I want to do this every Monday. So, yeah, I'm in the chat as Ascension Guide. I was thinking about making a little bit of a Telegram group.

So, if anybody wants to, you know, shoot me a PM, my PMs are open. You know, which is not the smartest thing to do, but my PMs are open. So, shoot me a PM. Like I could get, you know, whoever wants to, you know, jump on here or maybe has some topics they want for the next Miss Monday.

I want to do this every Monday. I want to start building the community to get to a point where we're having people actually engage rather than just waiting for the number to go up. Which is great and stuff, and I love Mist. But I think there's a lot of opportunity here when it comes to community building or even just building in general.

---

**SPEAKER_02:**
This is the oldest ERC-20, the first ERC-20 in all of Ethereum. There's a lot of cool things that we could do with this. We just need to make that community a bit tighter and focus on more than just financial incentives—though I know we're here to watch the number go up.

---

**SPEAKER_01:**
Number go up, bro.

---

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah, that's it. Number go up. 하지만 it's actually fun, man. Developing is fun. I was, you know, me and Victor, who leads the Discord and runs the social media, we were here since October, and we kind of pushed to get Mist, like, you know, the liquidity sufficient enough to start getting people to be able to buy and take part.

...

Here is the revised transcript with cleaned-up text, corrected terminology, and improved readability. Speaker names were adjusted only where identifiable and left generic otherwise:**

---

**SPEAKER_01:**
And just because XCopy is like a historical artist that has a big following, it makes it easier to trade it, rather than like an NFT and stuff. So, fractional.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Like somebody could get a fractional amount of that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, they could. I think, yeah, I think you can as well, but they're like... That, I feel like, people in the community would really bite and go for, just because it has to do with like Myst. So like, the legality thing of like an actual token, I agree with that. But something, just anything that could... something that could make people who are already invested in this feel like, you know, they're a part of something, or they got exclusive access to something because they're a holder—you know what I mean? Which starts there, and then from there we build out.

Yeah, no. More liquidity, attention, and education.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Well, I think a good way to rep that you own Myst could be smart, whether it be a PFP or something like that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Like how you guys were talking about those badges earlier. Yeah, back in the day, badges. Same thing with like the dude from Bankless, like with the POAP, you know, the Proof of Attendance Protocol. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, like that. You know what I’m saying? Like something similar.

And that could open up a whole bunch of other doors that could lead back to the thing you were talking about, of the DAO or society about the relics and collecting and stuff like that—everything leads back to one another.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah, I think there's a huge, huge market for these relics and stuff. And I’m not going to go through and shill any relics or anything like that. But there’s a huge... With any market, even video games and stuff, people are paying top dollar for the old, early video games—the ones that came out, some of the first ones.

Like, if you have some of those in mint condition, people are spending tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars for some of those things. Why is crypto any different? Especially in the fact that one year in crypto is like ten years, you know? That’s how fast it kind of moves.

So, I really see a huge opportunity in these early tokens, these early NFTs. I think like a PFP or something, which is something that I was kind of working on for Myst—or another token that I was going to move over to Myst. The only thing is, I kind of wanted to do it for free, or you locked up X amount of Myst and you got your token. You got an NFT. If you didn’t want your NFT anymore, you burned it, and you got your Myst back.

We could do a certain percentage or fee just to build up a little bit of, whether it be a treasury or some liquidity, to move over to Base because seeding Base liquidity would be really, really great. That was my main point.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, we should do that. That was the crux of what I was getting at, really.

**SPEAKER_03:**
It just needs to be tasteful because you don’t want to dilute what we have here.

Whether Myst has liquidity on Base or not, in my opinion—and this is not financial advice—it doesn’t matter. At some point, Myst is going to come across the right eyes, and this thing is going to blow up.

Now, it would be nice to have good liquidity on two chains just to give people more options. You know, ETH will, at some point—it’s hot right now—become pretty expensive to use. Not unusable, but very expensive, and that will drive a lot of people away. So, it would be nice to get another chain functional with cheaper gas.

People love ETH, and Base is... I do have some questions about Base, though. There are some things they said, like, if something did go down, I think they’d bend the knee to the SEC, and if you don’t give up your information, you wouldn’t be able to bridge out or something like that. It’s always a possibility.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, I’ve seen them handing out Wells notices and stuff.

I don’t even know what that is, but it’s probably...

**SPEAKER_03:**
A Wells notice?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. Oh, it’s pretty much, in layman’s terms, like a forewarning or chance. That’s what the SEC gives companies. Like, “Hey, just a heads-up. We think you’re doing something that falls out of bounds of the law.”

**SPEAKER_05:**
Yeah...

**SPEAKER_01:**
And this is your acknowledgement. It’s like, “This is your chance to realize we’re on you,” pretty much, or like, something’s coming. It’s not an official charge. It’s just kind of like a notice—an intent to prosecute.

**SPEAKER_05:**
Robinhood, I’ve seen it with some other exchanges. So, what you just said about Base—yes, that’s also something we should think about, you know—focusing too much of our eggs in that Base basket.

And, you know, just continuing to grow this Relic space.
'Cause the more that the Relic space grows, you know, the bigger opportunity it is for MISS.

So, I'm probably going to wrap it up there, guys. Anybody that wants to shoot me a PM, you're more than welcome. I appreciate everybody jumping on.

I think Alex had a lot of great things to say. Yeah, I'm excited for the future.

Alex Van De Sande:**
Appreciate you, man.

Aaron Wright:**
Thanks for your time, bro. Yeah, for sure.

I'll see you guys potentially next Monday. I want to do this every Monday, but at the very least, like every couple Mondays. So I'll keep everybody posted in the chat, in the MISS Telegram, and we'll talk there.

Thanks, everybody.
