QUALITY ASSESSMENT: EPISODE 008 - MICHAEL PARENTI
================================================================================
Guest: Michael Parenti
Generated: December 16, 2025

Supported Combinations: 12 (3 transcribers × 4 post-processors)

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

This quality report was refreshed after regenerating all 12 post-processing
outputs (opus, gemini, deepseek, chatgpt) for all 3 intermediate transcripts
(whisperx, whisperx-cloud, assemblyai).

IMPORTANT PIPELINE NOTE:
  Post-processing is now being run on the intermediate *.md transcripts
  (not the *.txt transcripts). This is required so post-processors can
  preserve the original timestamps.

KEY FINDINGS:

1) WORD-COUNT RETENTION is generally good
   Most outputs are ~90–103% of the input transcript word count.

2) TIMESTAMP PRESERVATION is now mostly correct
   Most processors preserve timestamps well when fed the intermediate .md.
   However, there are notable failures (see WhisperX-Cloud + Opus).

RECOMMENDED FOR THIS EPISODE:
  • AssemblyAI + DeepSeek
      - Best timestamp preservation (194/194)
      - High retention (98.7%)
  • WhisperX-Cloud + Gemini
      - Best timestamp preservation (26/26)
      - Good retention (97.5%)
  • WhisperX + DeepSeek
      - Preserves timestamps (100/100)
      - High retention (100.1%)

================================================================================
INPUT (INTERMEDIATE) TRANSCRIPTS
================================================================================

Word counts (baseline for retention; computed from the intermediate .md
transcripts with timestamps stripped):
  • episode008-michael-parenti_assemblyai.md:      4,540 words
  • episode008-michael-parenti_whisperx-cloud.md:  4,316 words
  • episode008-michael-parenti_whisperx.md:        4,427 words

Timestamp/header counts in intermediate .md (GROUND TRUTH timing):
  • episode008-michael-parenti_assemblyai.md:       194 timestamped headers
  • episode008-michael-parenti_whisperx-cloud.md:    26 timestamped headers
  • episode008-michael-parenti_whisperx.md:         100 timestamps (98 timestamped headers)

OUTPUT (POST-PROCESSED) WORD COUNT ANALYSIS

Legend:
  retention = output_words / input_words
  timestamps = output timestamp count / input timestamp count

================================================================================
QUALITY FLAGS / REVIEW NOTES
================================================================================

1) Timestamp count changes are the primary red flag
   Any output with far more timestamps than the input is not preserving the
   diarization paragraphing and is likely regenerating timestamps.

   CRITICAL failures observed:
     - whisperx-cloud + opus: 141 timestamps vs 26 input
     - whisperx + opus: 139 timestamps vs 100 input

RECOMMENDATION:
  • Use intermediate .md files as the canonical timestamped transcript.
  • Use post-processed .txt outputs for corrected wording / readability.
