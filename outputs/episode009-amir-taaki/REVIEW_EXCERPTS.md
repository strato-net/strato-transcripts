And one of the things I remember seeing earliest was the two Amirs that you had. Capitalist Amir and anarchist Amir. So tell me, you know, before all that started even, you know, how did your.

> Hello, hello. Hello, hello. Great to see you, my friend. So we are here. We are here in Prague, in beautiful Prague, dark Prague, the inaugural Dark Prague Zero Congress, conference, I'm not quite sure what you'd call it. But yeah, delighted to talk to you today, really within a context of this early days of Ethereum project that I've been looking at. And one of the things I remember seeing earliest was the two EMEAs that you had capitalist Amir and anarchist Amir. So tell me, you know, before all that started even, you know, how did your... Just curious, how come you're doing this project? How come I'm doing it? Yeah, yeah, what's the... Well, it was quite, I mean, it was quite coincidental, you know, I'd... I'd gathered a bunch of information back in 2017-2018 basically because Ming Chan was getting hoofed out and I asked Vitalik if what I could do to help, you know, anything with help with the transition or whatever. And he said, can you can you like go and talk to people in the community and sort of see what they think the Ethereum Foundation should be like? What should we be doing? Oh dear, if you ask that question, it's already a bad sign. Well, my question at that point was, so Ming was terrible. She was one of the least professional people I've ever worked with. She was an absolute nightmare. And my thought was, well... what the hell was happening before that, that she looked like a good choice. And there was a real sort of shroud of mystery as to what had happened then, even though it was only like three or four years before. And so like there just was no canonical history. Nobody really knew what happened. Even something as basic as like, was Charles like kind of a co-founder or not? He kind of says he was maybe, but maybe he wasn't. which is just crazy because, you know, he was there, like, doing videos and, like, there's just tons of evidence. But anyway, so I started digging back into that stuff. What about Anthony Di Iorio as well? Anthony Di Iorio, yes, that's right. Didn't he get rocked or something? There was Anthony Di Iorio. I don't know the history. There was Anthony D'Onofrio that was Texture. And there was another guy called Anthony Euphamio who did this Digix Gold thing. But anyway, that's where I started getting interested in Ethereum history. It's just like, well, what the hell happened? I mean, what ended up happening is everything I recommended to Vitalik never happened. It was just completely... a disaster. You know, Ming went and he just got AYA. Here you go. It's a new one. No changes. Like the, what people wanted was like transparency. They wanted community input. They wanted like professional executive, like operational. It's like, you know, let's have organization to help the devs basically. um but primarily it was like don't be a swiss opaque foundation with no accountability or any public information at all anyway so i put the stuff aside at that point it's like great that was a good use of my time you know advising the millionaire for free for months um but then just recently um So the guys I now work with, they started recording some videos. So Kieran James Lubin is Joe's son. So he was actually around from March 2014. And the others were sort of involved from 2015. And they were just like, we should like, get some of these memories down, right? It was like eight years ago at that point. So they did a couple of those videos and I really loved them and I was making tons of notes and finding links and photos and all of this. And then they interviewed me for the third one But then more recently, I did interviews with Taylor Goering and with Texture and just tons of stuff came out of that. And then I just kind of like shoved those together and there you go. That's early days of Ethereum is this sort of combination of sort of biographical stuff and photos and videos, links to articles, and then, you know, conversations with people. And it's really just because it's like this is history, right?

**Intermediate:**

> So I was working on free software for five, six years. And then I became a professional poker player. Right, right. That was for over two years. And the poker sites, you know, you're playing against other players. Right. But the way the sites operate, the platform, they take a cut. out of every pot, basically, every game that you play. Right. But the sites charge a huge amount of fees for a really crappy service. So I had this idea, what if you could have a P2P site, then it wouldn't have rake and fees. Right. So I had like the design for it, but then the main issue was the payment system. And so then I was on IRC in this channel with other anarcho-hackers I know. And I was telling them about that. And this guy just, he's like a mathematician that worked for the W3C. His name's Melvin. He dumped just like 10 links in there. And, you know, they're like random open source projects for like money. And there's stuff like Letts. Have you heard of Letts? No, no. That was, at one point, people were really into that. But it's like... I think it's like offering your labor, you get like a token or something, but anyway. So I was like going through all of these links and they were going, no, no, no, no. I saw Bitcoin, I opened the page for Bitcoin, it goes, Bitcoin is a P2P currency that cannot be controlled by governments or central banks. And I was like, that's garbage. Obviously not. Because there's like loads of random projects like that on SourceForge back in the day. I once saw like a Jurassic Park video game and it was going... Like, you could do everything. You can punch through the walls, you can hack the terminals, you can hunt the dinosaurs. And I was like, whoa, sounds amazing. And I checked the code and it said, like, main.cpp. And it had, like, just, you know. One file. Yeah, like, it just got bored of it. It just wrote the idea. Right, right. And then, like, I kept checking months every so often. And there was, like, zero progress on that. So I thought Bitcoin was, like, one of those kind of projects. I went, no, no, no, no, no. I was like, oh, they're all shit. So I was like, okay, let's take a deeper look at all of them then. And so then when it came to Bitcoin one, I downloaded the source code and I started going through the source code and I was like, oh, that's really interesting. First of all, Bitcoin source code is about 15,000 lines of code at that time. Yeah. which, you know, 15,000 lines of code, it's actually a small amount of lines of code. Like some programmers can even do that in like a week or something like very talented programmers. But so I was like, oh, but it's not nothing either. It's not like that Jurassic Park game I was just describing. So it's like 20, you know, 15,000 lines of code like less. You can read through and kind of understand that pretty well. Yeah, so I printed it all out and I covered it all over my floor. Right. You know, it's like my pornography that I'm looking at. I started studying it. Yeah. And it started to make sense. I was like, oh, very interesting. Oh, interesting. And so when I figured out how it worked, I was like, whoa, this is amazing. I'm going to work on this. So what month do you think that was? That was the summer of 2010. Right. So that's when I, like, basically, I was like, okay, I'm just doing this from now on. And so then I had, like, then I made, like, a plan of, like, oh, in 10 years we'll be here, et cetera. Right, right. Because this is, like, a long-term thing I'm going to work on. but then that basically just happened really quickly like just started growing massively so it's pretty crazy but i started working on bitcoin so i'm writing code you know i was one of the first five bitcoin developers which i was like listed on bitcoin dog right but that page is gone from the internet so people it's like maybe maybe it got archived No, I don't think so. No, just gone. The very first Bitcoin webpage with the list of names. Right. So, like, I had a war with Gavin Andreessen. Yep. Because he was, like, he's a motherfucker, like, in many ways. But... Basically, he really likes regulations and the state and stuff like that. He's a statist. And he's into the banks and stuff. But also, he was just not that good a dev. And when there was other young devs that were coming up, instead of trying to nurture them, he was instead trying to push them out and try and keep control. So I became his main enemy, basically. I was like his first enemy. And then he kind of seemed like he never wanted the role. Even he just sort of got kind of locked into it. Yeah. And then he was there and he's like, oh, I want to keep it. I really like it, you know. So, yeah, I went to the very first event presenting Bitcoin to the audience of bankers. And so I did my talking afterwards, Gavin Andreessen, he DM me and he goes, I think you should not talk at conferences ever again. I was like, who the fuck is this guy? You're not in charge of project. Fuck you. But was this in London or in the US? Amsterdam. Amsterdam. Yeah. But anyway, so You know, one of the first things that Gav Andreessen did was to try and get my name off of that list. He got his name added. But anyway. Right. So he was like that. And, you know...

But the sites charge a huge amount of fees for a really crappy service. So I had this idea, what if you could have a P2P site, then it wouldn't have rake and fees. Right. So I had the design for it, but then the main issue was the payment system. And so then I was on IRC in this channel with other anarcho-hackers I know. And I was telling them about that. And this guy, he's like a mathematician that worked for the W3C. His name's Melvin. He dumped just like 10 links in there. And they're like random open source projects for money. And there's stuff like LETS. Have you heard of LETS?

And there's stuff like LETS. Have you heard of LETS? No, no. That was, at one point, people were really into that. But I think it's like offering your labor, you get like a token or something, but anyway. So I was like going through all of these links and they were going, no, no, no, no. I saw Bitcoin, I opened the page for Bitcoin, it goes, Bitcoin is a P2P currency that cannot be controlled by governments or central banks. And I was like, that's garbage. Obviously not. Because there's like loads of random projects like that on SourceForge back in the day. I once saw like a Jurassic Park video game and it was going... Like, you could do everything. You can punch through the walls, you can hack the terminals, you can hunt the dinosaurs. And I was like, whoa, sounds amazing. And I checked the code and it said, like, main.cpp. And it had, like, just one file. Yeah, like, it just got bored of it. It just wrote the idea. Right, right. And then I kept checking months every so often. And there was zero progress on that. So I thought Bitcoin was like one of those kind of projects. I went, no, no, no, no, no. I was like, oh, they're all shit. So I was like, okay, let's take a deeper look at all of them then. And so then when it came to the Bitcoin one, I downloaded the source code and I started going through the source code and I was like, oh, that's really interesting. First of all, Bitcoin source code is about 15,000 lines of code at that time. Yeah. Which, you know, 15,000 lines of code, it's actually a small amount of lines of code. Like some programmers can even do that in like a week or something, like very talented programmers. But so I was like, oh, but it's not nothing either. It's not like that Jurassic Park game I was just describing. So it's like 20, you know, 15,000 lines of code like less. You can read through and kind of understand that pretty well. Yeah, so I printed it all out and I covered it all over my floor. Right. You know, it's like my pornography that I'm looking at. I started studying it. Yeah. And it started to make sense. I was like, oh, very interesting. Oh, interesting. And so when I figured out how it worked, I was like, whoa, this is amazing. I'm going to work on this. So what month do you think that was? That was the summer of 2010. Right. So that's when I basically, I was like, okay, I'm just doing this from now on. And so then I had like a plan of like, oh, in 10 years we'll be here, et cetera. Right, right. Because this is like a long-term thing I'm going to work on. But then that basically just happened really quickly. Like just started growing massively so it's pretty crazy but I started working on Bitcoin so I'm writing code. I was one of the first five Bitcoin developers which I was like listed on Bitcoin.org. Right. But that page is gone from the internet so people it's like maybe maybe it got archived. No, I don't think so. No, just gone. The very first Bitcoin webpage with the list of names. Right. So, like, I had a war with Gavin Andresen. Yep. Because he was, like, he's a motherfucker, like, in many ways. But basically he really likes regulations and the state and stuff like that. He's a statist. And he's into the banks and stuff. But also, he was just not that good a dev. And when there was other young devs that were coming up, instead of trying to nurture them, he was instead trying to push them out and try and keep control. So I became his main enemy, basically. I was like his first enemy. And then he kind of seemed like he never wanted the role. Even he just sort of got kind of locked into it. Yeah. And then he was there and he's like, oh, I want to keep it. I really like it, you know. So, yeah, I went to the very first event presenting Bitcoin to the audience of bankers. And so I did my talking afterwards, Gavin Andresen, he DM me and he goes, I think you should not talk at conferences ever again. I was like, who the fuck is this guy? You're not in charge of project. Fuck you. But was this in London or in the US? Amsterdam. Amsterdam. Yeah. But anyway, so you know, one of the first things that Gav Andresen did was to try and get my name off of that list. He got his name added. But anyway. Right. So he was like that. And, you know...
