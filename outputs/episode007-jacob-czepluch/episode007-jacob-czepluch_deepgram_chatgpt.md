**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:01] So hello?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:02] Hello, Bob.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:03] So, yes, I'm Bob Samuel, recording here at Dark Prague for Early Days of Ethereum.
[00:08] And I have here Jacob.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:10] Goodenough.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:11] Goodenough?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:12] Yes, there you go.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:14] So yeah, we've known each other about three years or so now.
[00:18] I think we did meet in Bogotá for Devcon 6 for the first time, where you introduced yourself.
[00:23] I was not aware of your background and role, but yeah, specifically, you were an intern at Dev in Berlin in late 2015, and you also attended Devcon One.
[00:35] So how did you come to be involved with Ethereum at that time?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:39] Oh yeah. Thank you for the intro and good question.
[00:42] Yeah, it was in Bogotá. I think I knew of you for longer than since then, but yeah, I think you were chatting with someone and talking about Florian—Florian Glatz maybe—and talking about the old days.
[00:54] And I just jumped in because I know Florian and found out that we have a shared interest in the old days of Ethereum.

[01:00] And yeah, I did my internship working on the Python client back starting September or August 2015.
[01:08] I think it was like maybe August to December?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:11] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:12] It was August to December.
[01:13] I think it was a couple of weeks after mainnet launched.
[01:16] And the first week I was there was when there was like the first big fork where the Go client forked from the—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:22] —Plus and Python client.
[01:24] There was a chain split on mainnet?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:26] Yes.
[01:27] And it happened, I think, the second day I was there.
[01:30] And that was the same day that there was a meetup planned in the office.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:34] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:35] So everything was extremely chaotic, and people arrived at the office for the meetup and nothing happened for a good amount of time.
[01:41] And eventually, I was just sitting there in the corner working, and I was like, no, we can't do this.
[01:46] Because there were so many people who were just looking—some started leaving.
[01:50] So I kind of ad hoc jumped in and gave a presentation on Ethereum back then that I had given a couple weeks before back in Copenhagen.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:58] Prior to your internship?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:59] Yeah.
[02:00] I gave the presentation prior to my internship because I started a Copenhagen Ethereum meetup group.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:05] Oh, goodness.
[02:06] So when do you think that started?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:08] I know exactly when it started.
[02:09] It started on 07/14/2015.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:12] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:13] And the reason I got into Ethereum was I was studying computer science.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:17] Okay.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:18] And I knew about Bitcoin and thought it would be interesting to write my bachelor thesis on Bitcoin.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:23] So this was an internship while you were still doing an undergraduate?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:26] No.
[02:27] It was actually an internship that I got because I wrote my bachelor thesis on Ethereum in the spring of '15.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:33] Oh, I see.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:34] So—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:35] So you had graduated?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:36] Yeah, but just a bachelor.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:38] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:39] And because the Ethereum ecosystem, so to speak, was so small back then—

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:43] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:44] We were in contact with the Ethereum Foundation during the internship.
[02:47] I think I opened my first issue in March 2015 to like the C++ client or something like that.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:53] Okay.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:54] So yeah, I actually—I think I've known of Ethereum since 2014.
[02:59] But anyway, just yeah.
[03:01] We wrote this bachelor thesis—me and two of my friends—and we shared it with the Foundation, and then we got offered internships.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:08] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:09] I was the only one—like, I was tired of studying already only after a bachelor, and the other two guys wanted to continue.
[03:15] So I was like, okay, I'm gonna do this.
[03:17] And a couple weeks later, moved to Berlin to do my internship working on the Python client.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:22] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:23] And yeah, that was a very interesting time.
[03:26] Like, thinking back now, I'm sad I didn't write down more things or take more pictures or appreciate some of the things a little bit more.
[03:33] But I also had no idea that things would get as big as they are now.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:37] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:38] But yeah, I enjoyed it a lot.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:40] So, I mean, it was primarily C++ development under Gav that was happening in that office, right?
[03:45] But also Felix Lange, I know, was there on the Geth team.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:48] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:49] There were some different people out there. Then some Python dev—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:52] He was doing Go stuff.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:53] Right.
[03:54] And yeah, the Solidity team was also there.
[03:56] I think they were under the C++ team.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:58] That's right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:59] But they were there. And Remix as well—well, Mix, sorry, at the time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:03] And I also remember Mist, I guess.
[04:06] At least Fabian was also around.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:08] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:09] So there was a good amount of different people around.
[04:12] And also, quite often, people would come and visit from other places.
[04:16] I remember a couple of times, Christoph Jentzsch came to visit.
[04:20] There was one time where I think he arrived at midnight or something like that, and there was no one else at the office.
[04:25] And I was doing my internship, and I think he wrote in the late afternoon on the Skype channel if there would be someone around and that he was a little bit delayed or whatever.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:33] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:34] So I was just like, oh, it's fine.
[04:36] I had nothing to do in Berlin anyway.
[04:38] I had like the smallest room—just like a small room with a bed, nothing else basically.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:42] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:43] So I enjoyed spending a lot of time in the office, and I actually had like—I would usually just stay in the office and then just go home and sleep because the office was quite nice.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:51] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:52] So yeah, I had one night where I think I let him into the office at midnight and we had a little bit of a chat.
[04:58] I got to know him.
[04:59] He told me about all the testing he was doing and how they were testing.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:03] Right.
[05:04] And that’s cross-client testing as well, wasn’t it?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:06] Right.
[05:07] If I remember correctly, he was building a lot of JSON data that they fed to the client.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:11] And that was from the C++ client.
[05:13] I know that cpp-ethereum was leading and the tests were generated from that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:17] Mhmm.
[05:18] But then running those against the Python and Geth clients.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:21] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:22] That sounds about right.
[05:23] But yeah, there are a lot of small stories.
[05:25] I don't know why—you told me we don't have too much time.
[05:27] I'll try to keep it short.
[05:28] But I would say if I think back to the most interesting things that happened, it was like, of course, being lucky enough to participate at Devcon One.

[05:36] And also experience the kind of split that was taking place at this point in time because the Foundation, I think, almost ran out of money.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:43] Yep, that’s right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:44] The C++ team was kind of cut off.
