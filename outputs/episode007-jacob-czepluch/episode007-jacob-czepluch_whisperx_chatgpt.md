**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:01] So, hello.
[00:02] Hello, Bob.
[00:04] So yes, I'm Bob Samuel, recording here at Dark Prague for Early Days of Ethereum.
[00:09] And I have here Jakub Ciepluch.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:12] Good enough.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:13] Good enough?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:14] Ciepluch.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:15] Yes, there you go.
[00:17] So yeah, we've known each other about three years or so now.
[00:20] I think we did meet in Bogotá for Devcon 6 for the first time, where you introduced yourself.
[00:25] I was not aware of your background and role, but...
[00:28] But yeah, specifically, you were an intern at DEV in Berlin in late 2015, and you also attended Devcon 1.
[00:35] So how did you come to be involved with Ethereum at that time?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:39] Oh yeah, thank you for the intro and good question.
[00:42] It was in Bogotá.
[00:44] I think I knew about you or of you for longer than since then.
[00:48] But yeah, I think you were chatting with someone and talking about Florian Glatz maybe, and talking about the old days.
[00:54] And I just jumped in because I know Florian and found out that we have a shared interest in the old days of Ethereum.
[01:00] And yeah, I did my internship working on the Python client back starting September or August 2015.
[01:07] I think it was like—

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:08] Maybe August to December?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:09] Yeah, it was August to December.
[01:11] It was a couple of weeks after mainnet launched, and the first week I was there was when there was like the first big fork where the Go client forked from the C++ and Python client.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:21] There was a chain split on mainnet?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:23] Yes.
[01:24] And it happened, I think, the second day I was there.
[01:27] And that was the same day that there was a meetup planned in the office.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:30] Right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:31] So everything was extremely chaotic, and people arrived at the office for the meetup and nothing happened for a good amount of time.
[01:37] And eventually I was just sitting there in the corner working and I was like, no, we can't do this because there's so many people who are just like looking.
[01:43] Some started leaving.
[01:45] So I kind of ad hoc jumped in and gave a presentation on Ethereum back then that I had given a couple of weeks before back in Copenhagen.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:52] Prior to your internship?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:53] Yeah, I gave the presentation prior to my internship because I started a Copenhagen Ethereum meetup group.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:58] Oh, goodness.
[01:59] So when do you think that started?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:01] I know exactly when it started.
[02:03] It started on the 14th of July 2015.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:06] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:07] And the reason I got into Ethereum was I was studying computer science.
[02:11] And I knew about Bitcoin and thought it would be interesting to write my bachelor thesis on Bitcoin.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:16] So this was an internship while you were still doing an undergraduate?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:19] No, it was actually an internship that I got because I wrote my bachelor thesis on Ethereum in the spring of 2015.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:25] I see.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:26] So I had graduated.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:27] Yeah, but just a bachelor.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:29] Right.
[02:30] And because the Ethereum ecosystem, so to speak, was so small back then...

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:33] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:34] We were in contact with the Ethereum Foundation during the internship.
[02:37] I think I opened my first issue in March 2015 to the C++ client or something like that.
[02:42] I've known of Ethereum since the end of 2014, but anyway.
[02:46] We wrote the bachelor thesis, me and two of my friends, and we shared it with the Foundation, and then we got offered internships.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:53] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:54] And I was the only one.
[02:56] I was tired of studying already, only after a bachelor, and the other two guys wanted to continue, so I was like, okay, I'm going to do this.
[03:02] And a couple of weeks later, I moved to Berlin to do my internship working on the Python client.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:07] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:08] And yeah, that was a very interesting time.
[03:11] Thinking back now, I'm sad I didn't write down more things or take more pictures or appreciate some of the things a little bit more.
[03:18] But I also had no idea that things would get as big as they are now.
[03:22] But yeah, I enjoyed it a lot.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:24] So I mean, it was primarily C++ development under Gav that was happening in that office, right?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:29] But also Felix Lange, I know, was there on the Geth team.
[03:32] Yeah, there were some different people.
[03:34] I remember Gustav Simonsen, I think he was doing Go stuff.
[03:37] And yeah, the Solidity team was also there.
[03:40] I think they were under the C++ team back then, but they were there.
[03:44] And Remix as well—well, Mix, sorry, at the time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:47] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:48] And I also remember The Mist, I guess.
[03:50] At least Fabian Vogelsteller was also around.
[03:53] So there was a good amount of different people around.
[03:56] And also, quite often people would come and visit from other places.
[04:00] I remember a couple of times Christoph Jentzsch came to visit.
[04:03] There was one time where I think he arrived at midnight or something like that.
[04:07] And there was no one else at the office.
[04:09] I was doing my internship, and I think he wrote late afternoon.
[04:12] He wrote on the Skype channel if there would be someone around and that he was a little bit delayed or whatever.
[04:17] So I was just like, oh, it's fine.
[04:19] I had nothing to do in Berlin anyway.
[04:21] I had the smallest room—just like a small room with a bed, nothing else basically.
[04:26] So I enjoyed spending a lot of time in the office, and I actually had like—I would usually just stay in the office and then just go home and sleep because the office was quite nice.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:34] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:35] Yeah, I had one night where I think I let him into the office at midnight and we had a little bit of a chat.
[04:40] I got to know him.
[04:41] He told me about all the testing he was doing and how they were testing.
[04:45] It was quite interesting.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:46] And that's cross-client testing as well, wasn't it?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:48] Yeah, if I remember correctly, he was building a lot of JSON data that they fed to the clients.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:52] And that was from the C++ client, I know, that cpp-ethereum was leading.
[04:56] And the tests were generated from that, but then running those against the Python and Geth clients.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:00] Yeah, that sounds about right.
[05:02] There are a lot more stories.
[05:04] You told me we don't have too much time.
[05:06] I'll try to keep it short.
[05:07] I would say if I think back to the most interesting things that happened, it was like—
[05:11] Of course, being lucky enough to participate at Devcon 1.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:14] Right, yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:15] And also experience the kind of split that was taking place at this point in time because the Foundation, I think, almost ran out of money.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:22] Yeah, that's right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:23] And the C++ team was kind of cut off.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:25] And you also had, you know, Ming Chan—her first official date was 1st of August of 2015.
[05:30] So yeah, you basically had those kind of cost-cutting measures coming in quite fast, looking at the spend where...
[05:36] You know, it had been going for a year.
[05:38] It was the July of the previous year that the Foundation had been formed and you had the crowdsale, but nearly all of the money was gone in that year.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:45] Yeah, and I think that was also maybe not the most responsible usage of money.
[05:50] But also the Bitcoin price was doing really poorly.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:53] Yeah, that's right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:54] And the Ether price itself was also—I think it dipped below the pre-sale price at some point in September.
[05:59] A year in and you've had no accumulation.
[06:01] But yeah, I didn't have any interactions with Ming back then.
[06:04] Actually, one thing I just remembered now—I was actually supposed to have done my internship on the C++ team in London.
[06:11] But a couple of weeks before that, I was told, sorry, we can't do it anyway because we don't have the money anymore.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:17] Well, because they were getting very rapidly the funding—or even shut down entirely, I think.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:21] Yeah, probably already.
[06:23] Or that was coming.
[06:24] Yeah, so that's why it ended up being the Python team instead, because there was some budget.
[06:29] But yeah, like sitting as the only person working on the Python client in that office in my small corner, I had a lot of fun kind of following how people came and went and went into Gavin's office and had a chat there with him in Utah or whatever.
[06:42] And I didn't really know in the beginning what was going on until I was also asked if I wanted to come in and talk.
[06:48] And it was basically like presenting ideas of what would happen next with the C++ team and if we wanted to consider joining there or whatever.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:56] So that was sort of the pre-formation of what became Ethcore, later Parity.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[07:00] Yeah, I think so.
[07:01] I was witnessing that without knowing what was going on.
[07:04] I had no insight into the finances of the Foundation or anything like that.
[07:07] I only found out about most of those things later.
[07:10] But it was quite interesting to see.
