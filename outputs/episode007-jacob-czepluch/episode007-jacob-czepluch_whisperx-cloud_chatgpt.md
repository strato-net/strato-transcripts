**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:01] So, hello. Hello, Bob. So, yes, I'm Bob Samuel, recording here at Dark Prague for Early Days of Ethereum.
[00:07] And I have here Jakub Ciepluch.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:09] Good enough.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:10] Good enough. Ciepluch.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:11] Yes, there you go.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:12] So, yeah, we've known each other about three years or so now.
[00:15] I think we did meet in Bogotá for Devcon 6 for the first time, where you introduced yourself.
[00:20] I was not aware of your background and role, but...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:23] But yeah, specifically, you were an intern at DEV in Berlin in late 2015, and you also attended Devcon 1.
[00:30] So how did you come to be involved with Ethereum at that time?

[00:33] Oh, yeah. Thank you for the intro. And good question.
[00:36] It was in Bogotá. I think I knew about you or of you for longer than since then.
[00:41] But yeah, I think you were chatting with someone and talking about the old days, and I just jumped in because I know Florian and found out that we have a shared interest in the old days of Ethereum.

[00:52] And yeah, I did my internship working on the Python client back starting September or August 2015.
[00:59] I think it was like... maybe August to December?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:02] Yeah, it was August to December.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:04] It was a couple of weeks after mainnet launched, and the first week I was there was when there was like the first big fork where the Go client forked from the C++ and Python client.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:14] There was a chain split on mainnet?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:16] Yes. And it happened, I think, the second day I was there.
[01:19] And that was the same day that there was a meetup planned in the office.

[01:23] Right.

[01:24] So everything was extremely chaotic, and people arrived at the office for the meetup, and nothing happened for a good amount of time.
[01:30] And eventually, I was just sitting there in the corner working, and I was like, no, we can't do this because there's so many people who are just like looking.
[01:37] Some started leaving, so I kind of ad hoc jumped in and gave a presentation on Ethereum back then that I had given a couple weeks before back in Copenhagen.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:46] Prior to your internship?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:47] Yeah, I gave the presentation prior to my internship because I started a Copenhagen Ethereum meetup group.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:52] Oh, goodness. So when do you think that started?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:54] I know exactly when it started. It started on the 14th of July 2015.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:58] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:59] And the reason I got into Ethereum was I was studying computer science.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:03] Okay.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:04] And I knew about Bitcoin and thought it would be interesting to write my bachelor thesis on Bitcoin.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:08] Okay. So this was an internship while you were still doing an undergraduate?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:12] No, it was actually an internship that I got because I wrote my bachelor thesis on Ethereum in the spring of 2015.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:18] I see. So you had graduated.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:20] Yeah, but just a bachelor.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:21] Right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:22] And because the Ethereum ecosystem, so to speak, was so small back then...

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:26] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:27] We were in contact with the Ethereum Foundation during the internship.
[02:30] I think I opened my first issue in March 2015 to the C++ client or something like that.
[02:35] I've known of Ethereum since the end of 2014.
[02:38] We wrote this bachelor thesis, me and two of my friends, and we shared it with the Foundation, and then we got offered internships.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:45] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:46] And I was the only one— I was tired of studying already, only after a bachelor, and the other two guys wanted to continue.
[02:52] So I was like, okay, I'm going to do this.
[02:54] And a couple of weeks later, I moved to Berlin to do my internship working on the Python client.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:59] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:00] And yeah, that was a very interesting time.
[03:03] Thinking back now, I'm sad I didn't write down more things or take more pictures or appreciate some of the things a little bit more.
[03:10] But I also had no idea that things would get as big as they are now.

[03:14] But yeah, I enjoyed it a lot.
[03:16] So, I mean, it was primarily C++ development under Gav that was happening in that office, right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:21] But also Felix Lange, I know, was there on the Geth team.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:24] Yeah, there were some different people.
[03:26] I remember Gustav Simonsson, I think he was doing Go stuff.
[03:29] And yeah, the Solidity team was also there.
[03:32] I think they were under the C++ team back then, but they were there.

[03:36] And Remix as well. Well, Mix, sorry, at the time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:39] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:40] And I also remember the Mist, I guess.
[03:42] At least Fabian Vogelsteller was also around.
[03:45] So there was a good amount of different people around.
[03:48] And also quite often people would come and visit from other places.
[03:52] I remember a couple of times Christoph Jentzsch came to visit.
[03:56] There was one time where I think he arrived at midnight or something like that.
[04:00] And there was no one else at the office.
[04:02] I was doing my internship, and I think he wrote late afternoon, he wrote on the Skype channel if there would be someone around and that he was a little bit delayed or whatever.
[04:10] So I was just like, oh, it's fine. I had nothing to do in Berlin anyway.
[04:14] I had the smallest room— just like a small room with a bed, nothing else basically.
[04:19] So I enjoyed spending a lot of time in the office, and I would usually just stay in the office and then just go home and sleep because the office was quite nice.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:27] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:28] Yeah, I had one night where I think I let him into the office at midnight and we had a little bit of a chat.
[04:33] I got to know him. He told me about all the testing he was doing and how they were testing. It was quite interesting.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:39] And that's cross-client testing as well, wasn't it?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:41] Yeah, if I remember correctly, he was building a lot of JSON data that they fed to the clients.
[04:46] And that was from the C++ client, I know, that cpp-ethereum was leading.
[04:50] And the tests were generated from that, but then running those against the Python and Geth clients.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:55] Yeah, that sounds about right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:57] There are a lot of small stories.
[04:59] You told me we don't have too much time. I'll try to keep it short.
[05:02] I would say if I think back to the most interesting things that happened, it was like...
[05:06] Of course, being lucky enough to participate at Devcon 1.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:09] Right, yeah.
[05:10] And also experience the kind of split that was taking place at this point in time because the Foundation, I think, almost ran out of money.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:17] Yeah, that's right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:18] And the C++ team was kind of cut off.
[05:21] And you also had, you know, Ming Chan— her first official date was 1st of August of 2015.
[05:26] So, yeah, you basically had those kind of cost-cutting measures coming in quite fast, looking at the spend where...
[05:32] It had been going for a year. It was the July of the previous year that the Foundation had been formed and you had the crowdsale, but nearly all of the money was gone in that year.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:41] Yeah, and I think that was also maybe not the most responsible usage of money, but also the Bitcoin price was doing really poorly.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[05:49] Yeah, that's right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[05:50] And the Ether price itself was also— I think it dipped below the pre-sale price at some point in September 2015.
[05:56] A year in and you've had no accumulation.
[05:59] But yeah, I didn't have any interactions with Ming back then.
[06:02] Actually, one thing I just remembered now— I was actually supposed to have done my internship on the C++ team in London,
[06:09] but a couple of weeks before that, I was told, sorry, we can't do it anyway because we don't have the money anymore.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:15] Right. Well, because they were getting very rapidly the funding or even shut down entirely, I think.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[06:20] Yeah, probably already. Or that was coming.
[06:23] Yeah, so that's why it ended up being the Python team instead because there was some budget.
[06:27] But yeah, like sitting as the only person working on the Python client in that office in my small corner,
[06:33] I had a lot of fun kind of following how people came and went and went into Gavin's office and had a chat there with him in Utah or whatever.
[06:41] And I didn't really know in the beginning what was going on until I was also asked if I wanted to come in and talk.
[06:46] And it was basically like presenting ideas of what would happen next with the C++ team and if they wanted to consider joining there or whatever.
[06:54] So that was sort of the pre-formation of what became Ethcore, later Parity.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[06:59] Yeah, I think so.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[07:00] I was witnessing that without knowing what was going on.
[07:03] I had no insight into the finances of the Foundation or anything like that.
[07:06] I only found out about most of those things later.
[07:09] But it was quite interesting to see.

[07:11] Yeah, so maybe let's talk about Devcon 1.
[07:14] So the first Devcon was Devcon 0...

**SPEAKER_01:**
[07:17] Which happened in November 2014, before your time, which was the closed event.
[07:21] Mainly Ethereum Foundation-y people, but some broader ecosystem people.
[07:25] But then Devcon 1 happened in November 2015 in London.
[07:29] It had got announced early in the year and got cancelled because of this funding squeeze,
[07:34] but ConsenSys basically stepped up and filled that funding gap and did some organizing.
[07:39] So that was in November of that year.
[07:41] I was not present myself. I couldn't afford to go or whatever at the time,
[07:45] but I watched a lot of the livestream.
[07:47] But, you know, that was a really very seminal conference. So how was that?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[07:52] For me, it was amazing.
