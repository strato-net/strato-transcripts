**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:01] So, hello.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:02] Hello, Bob.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:03] So yes, I'm Bob Samuel, recording here at Dark Prague for Early Days of Ethereum.
[00:08] And I have here Jakob.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:10] Good enough?

**SPEAKER_00:**
[00:11] Good enough, yes.
[00:13] There you go.
[00:14] So yeah, we've known each other about three years or so now, I think.
[00:18] We did meet in Bogotá for Devcon 6 for the first time where you introduced yourself.
[00:23] I was not aware of your background and role, but yeah, specifically you were an intern at FDEV in Berlin in late 2015 and you also attended Devcon 1.
[00:32] So how did you come to be involved with Ethereum at that time?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[00:36] Oh yeah, thank you for the intro and good question.
[00:39] It was in Bogotá.
[00:41] I think I knew about you or of you for longer than since then.
[00:45] But yeah, I think you were chatting with someone and talking about Florian Glatz, maybe, and talking about the old days.
[00:51] And I just jumped in because I know Florian and found out that we have a shared interest in the old days of Ethereum.
[00:57] And yeah, I did my internship working on the Python client back starting September or August 2015.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:03] I think it was like maybe August to December?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:05] Yeah, it was August to December.
[01:07] It was a couple of weeks after mainnet launched.
[01:10] And the first week I was there was when there was like the first big fork where the Go client forked from the C and Python client.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:17] There was a chain split on mainnet.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:19] Yes.
[01:20] And it happened, I think, the second day I was there.
[01:23] And that was the same day that there was a meetup planned in the office.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:27] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:28] So everything was extremely chaotic and people arrived at the office for the meetup and nothing happened for a good amount of time.
[01:34] And eventually I was just sitting there in the corner working and I was like, no, we can't do this because there's so many people who are just like, looking.
[01:41] Some started leaving.
[01:42] So I kind of ad hoc jumped in and gave a presentation on Ethereum back then that I had given a couple of weeks before back in Copenhagen.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:49] Prior to your internship?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:50] Yeah, I gave the presentation prior to my internship because I started a Copenhagen Ethereum meetup group.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[01:55] Oh, goodness.
[01:56] So when do you think that started?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[01:58] I know exactly when it started.
[02:00] It started on the 14th of July 2015.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:03] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:04] And the reason I got into Ethereum, I was studying computer science.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:07] Okay.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:08] And I knew about Bitcoin and thought it would be interesting to write my bachelor thesis on Bitcoin.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:12] So this was an internship while you were still doing an undergraduate?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:15] No, it was actually an internship that I got because I wrote my bachelor thesis on Ethereum in the spring of 2015.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:21] So you had graduated.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:22] Yeah, but just a bachelor.
[02:24] And because the Ethereum ecosystem, so to speak, was so small back then...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:27] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:28] We were in contact with the Ethereum Foundation during the internship.
[02:31] I think I opened my first issue in March 2015.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[02:34] Right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[02:35] To like the C++ client or something like that.
[02:37] So yeah, I actually, I think I've known of Ethereum since end of 2014.
[02:42] But anyway, yeah, we wrote this bachelor thesis, me and two of my friends, and we shared it with the Foundation and then we got offered internships.
[02:49] And I was the only one— I was tired of studying already, only after a bachelor, and the other two guys wanted to continue.
[02:55] So I was like, okay, I'm going to do this.
[02:57] And a couple of weeks later I moved to Berlin to do my internship working on the Python client.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:02] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:03] And yeah, that was a very interesting time.
[03:06] Thinking back now, I'm sad I didn't write down more things or take more pictures or appreciate some of the things a little bit more, but I also had no idea that things would get as big as they are now.
[03:14] But yeah, I enjoyed it a lot.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:16] So, I mean, it was primarily C++ development under Gav that was happening in that office, right?
[03:21] But also Felix Lange, I know, was there on the guest.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:24] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:25] And then some different people and then...

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:27] Some Python. Simon de la Rouviere, I think he was doing Go stuff.
[03:30] And yeah, the Solidity team was also there.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:32] I think they were under the C++ team, that's right, back then.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:35] But they were.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:36] And Remix as well— well, Mix, sorry, at the time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:39] Yeah, yeah.
[03:40] And I also remember Mist.
[03:42] I guess at least Fabian Vogelsteller was also around.
[03:45] So there was a good amount of different...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:47] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:48] ...people around.
[03:49] And also quite often people would come and visit from other places.
[03:52] I remember a couple of times Christoph Jentzsch came to visit.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[03:55] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[03:56] There was one time where I think he arrived at midnight or something like that and there was no one else at the office.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:00] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:01] I was doing my internship and I think he wrote like late afternoon.
[04:04] He wrote on the Skype channel if there would be someone around, that he was a little bit delayed or whatever.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:08] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:09] So I was just like, oh, it's fine.
[04:11] I had nothing to do in Berlin anyway.
[04:13] I had like the smallest room, just like a small room with a bed, nothing else, basically.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:17] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:18] So I enjoyed spending a lot of time in the office and I actually had like— I would usually just stay in the office.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:23] Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:24] And then just go home and sleep because the office was quite nice.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:27] Right, right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:28] So yeah, I had one night where I think I let him into the office at midnight and we had a little bit of a chat.
[04:34] I got to know him.
[04:35] He told me about all the testing he was doing and how they were testing.
[04:38] It was quite interesting.

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:40] And that's cross-client testing as well, wasn't it?

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:42] Right, yeah.
[04:43] If I remember correctly, he was building a lot of just JSON data that they fed to the client and that...

**SPEAKER_00:**
[04:47] Was from the C++ client.
[04:48] I know that cpp-ethereum was leading and the tests were generated from that, but then running those against the Python and Geth clients.

**SPEAKER_01:**
[04:55] Yeah, that sounds about right.
[04:57] But there are a lot of small stories he told me.
[04:59] We don't have too much time, I'll try to keep it short.
[05:01] But I would say if I think back to the most interesting things that happened, it was of course being lucky enough to participate at Devcon 1.
