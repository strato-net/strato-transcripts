**SPEAKER_01:**
So, hello. Hello, Bob. So, yes, I'm Bob Samuel, recording here at Dark Prague for Early Days of Ethereum.
And I have here Jakub Ciepluch.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Good enough.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Good enough. Ciepluch.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes, there you go.

**SPEAKER_01:**
So, yeah, we've known each other about three years or so now.
I think we did meet in Bogotá for Devcon 6 for the first time, where you introduced yourself.
I was not aware of your background and role, but...

**SPEAKER_00:**
But yeah, specifically, you were an intern at DEV in Berlin in late 2015, and you also attended Devcon 1.
So how did you come to be involved with Ethereum at that time?

Oh, yeah. Thank you for the intro. And good question.
It was in Bogotá. I think I knew about you or of you for longer than since then.
But yeah, I think you were chatting with someone and talking about the old days, and I just jumped in because I know Florian and found out that we have a shared interest in the old days of Ethereum.

And yeah, I did my internship working on the Python client back starting September or August 2015.
I think it was like... maybe August to December?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, it was August to December.

**SPEAKER_00:**
It was a couple of weeks after mainnet launched, and the first week I was there was when there was like the first big fork where the Go client forked from the C++ and Python client.

**SPEAKER_01:**
There was a chain split on mainnet?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yes. And it happened, I think, the second day I was there.
And that was the same day that there was a meetup planned in the office.

Right.

So everything was extremely chaotic, and people arrived at the office for the meetup, and nothing happened for a good amount of time.
And eventually, I was just sitting there in the corner working, and I was like, no, we can't do this because there's so many people who are just like looking.
Some started leaving, so I kind of ad hoc jumped in and gave a presentation on Ethereum back then that I had given a couple weeks before back in Copenhagen.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Prior to your internship?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, I gave the presentation prior to my internship because I started a Copenhagen Ethereum meetup group.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Oh, goodness. So when do you think that started?

**SPEAKER_00:**
I know exactly when it started. It started on the 14th of July 2015.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And the reason I got into Ethereum was I was studying computer science.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I knew about Bitcoin and thought it would be interesting to write my bachelor thesis on Bitcoin.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Okay. So this was an internship while you were still doing an undergraduate?

**SPEAKER_00:**
No, it was actually an internship that I got because I wrote my bachelor thesis on Ethereum in the spring of 2015.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I see. So you had graduated.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, but just a bachelor.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And because the Ethereum ecosystem, so to speak, was so small back then...

**SPEAKER_01:**
Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
We were in contact with the Ethereum Foundation during the internship.
I think I opened my first issue in March 2015 to the C++ client or something like that.
I've known of Ethereum since the end of 2014.
We wrote this bachelor thesis, me and two of my friends, and we shared it with the Foundation, and then we got offered internships.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I was the only one— I was tired of studying already, only after a bachelor, and the other two guys wanted to continue.
So I was like, okay, I'm going to do this.
And a couple of weeks later, I moved to Berlin to do my internship working on the Python client.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And yeah, that was a very interesting time.
Thinking back now, I'm sad I didn't write down more things or take more pictures or appreciate some of the things a little bit more.
But I also had no idea that things would get as big as they are now.

But yeah, I enjoyed it a lot.
So, I mean, it was primarily C++ development under Gav that was happening in that office, right?

**SPEAKER_01:**
But also Felix Lange, I know, was there on the Geth team.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, there were some different people.
I remember Gustav Simonsson, I think he was doing Go stuff.
And yeah, the Solidity team was also there.
I think they were under the C++ team back then, but they were there.

And Remix as well. Well, Mix, sorry, at the time.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And I also remember the Mist, I guess.
At least Fabian Vogelsteller was also around.
So there was a good amount of different people around.
And also quite often people would come and visit from other places.
I remember a couple of times Christoph Jentzsch came to visit.
There was one time where I think he arrived at midnight or something like that.
And there was no one else at the office.
I was doing my internship, and I think he wrote late afternoon, he wrote on the Skype channel if there would be someone around and that he was a little bit delayed or whatever.
So I was just like, oh, it's fine. I had nothing to do in Berlin anyway.
I had the smallest room— just like a small room with a bed, nothing else basically.
So I enjoyed spending a lot of time in the office, and I would usually just stay in the office and then just go home and sleep because the office was quite nice.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Right, right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, I had one night where I think I let him into the office at midnight and we had a little bit of a chat.
I got to know him. He told me about all the testing he was doing and how they were testing. It was quite interesting.

**SPEAKER_01:**
And that's cross-client testing as well, wasn't it?

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, if I remember correctly, he was building a lot of JSON data that they fed to the clients.
And that was from the C++ client, I know, that cpp-ethereum was leading.
And the tests were generated from that, but then running those against the Python and Geth clients.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, that sounds about right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
There are a lot of small stories.
You told me we don't have too much time. I'll try to keep it short.
I would say if I think back to the most interesting things that happened, it was like...
Of course, being lucky enough to participate at Devcon 1.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Right, yeah.
And also experience the kind of split that was taking place at this point in time because the Foundation, I think, almost ran out of money.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, that's right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
And the C++ team was kind of cut off.
And you also had, you know, Ming Chan— her first official date was 1st of August of 2015.
So, yeah, you basically had those kind of cost-cutting measures coming in quite fast, looking at the spend where...
It had been going for a year. It was the July of the previous year that the Foundation had been formed and you had the crowdsale, but nearly all of the money was gone in that year.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, and I think that was also maybe not the most responsible usage of money, but also the Bitcoin price was doing really poorly.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, that's right.

**SPEAKER_00:**
And the Ether price itself was also— I think it dipped below the pre-sale price at some point in September 2015.
A year in and you've had no accumulation.
But yeah, I didn't have any interactions with Ming back then.
Actually, one thing I just remembered now— I was actually supposed to have done my internship on the C++ team in London,
but a couple of weeks before that, I was told, sorry, we can't do it anyway because we don't have the money anymore.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Right. Well, because they were getting very rapidly the funding or even shut down entirely, I think.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, probably already. Or that was coming.
Yeah, so that's why it ended up being the Python team instead because there was some budget.
But yeah, like sitting as the only person working on the Python client in that office in my small corner,
I had a lot of fun kind of following how people came and went and went into Gavin's office and had a chat there with him in Utah or whatever.
And I didn't really know in the beginning what was going on until I was also asked if I wanted to come in and talk.
And it was basically like presenting ideas of what would happen next with the C++ team and if they wanted to consider joining there or whatever.
So that was sort of the pre-formation of what became Ethcore, later Parity.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, I think so.

**SPEAKER_00:**
I was witnessing that without knowing what was going on.
I had no insight into the finances of the Foundation or anything like that.
I only found out about most of those things later.
But it was quite interesting to see.

Yeah, so maybe let's talk about Devcon 1.
So the first Devcon was Devcon 0...

**SPEAKER_01:**
Which happened in November 2014, before your time, which was the closed event.
Mainly Ethereum Foundation-y people, but some broader ecosystem people.
But then Devcon 1 happened in November 2015 in London.
It had got announced early in the year and got cancelled because of this funding squeeze,
but ConsenSys basically stepped up and filled that funding gap and did some organizing.
So that was in November of that year.
I was not present myself. I couldn't afford to go or whatever at the time,
but I watched a lot of the livestream.
But, you know, that was a really very seminal conference. So how was that?

**SPEAKER_00:**
For me, it was amazing.
