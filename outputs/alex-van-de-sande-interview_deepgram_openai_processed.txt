SPEAKER_00:
What's going on, everybody?
Alex, I sent you an invite to speak
and cohost.
If you have any questions, just let me know. You can DM me.
Good to see the faces piling in.
Got a lot of good questions here. Can't wait to talk about just the rich history here.
Here.
There we go.
Alex, good to have you here, man. Appreciate it.
If anybody else wants to come up later and ask any questions,
just feel free to raise your hand.

SPEAKER_01:
Kinda.
Kinda a bit, like, underwater.

SPEAKER_00:
Is Victor out here? No. Victor. Okay.
Let me see.
Just give us a few moments, guys, trying to set this up. Appreciate your patience.
Technology.
Cartoons, you wanna come up?
I'll invite you.
Even if you're just on a panel, you don't gotta speak.
You are here for episode zero.
But you
got you, Mac.
Wishing my phone wasn't so dumb. I'd DJ some stuff here instead of this silence.

SPEAKER_02:
You should sing, AG.

SPEAKER_00:
Who’s—who said that? Alex? Hey.

SPEAKER_02:
Hey. You should—you should play some live music.

SPEAKER_01:
I—I—I was playing some classical music, but,
yeah, I don't know. It's—it's good to have you on here. I'm glad the mic's all working out now. I really appreciate you jumping on.
It's been an interesting six months for sure.
So, really, I just wanna kinda just pick your brain a bit about the past, honestly. Like,
more than just, you know, Mist Wallet in general, but really just, like, how
you got all started with, you know, the Ethereum Foundation and whatnot. So, like, when did you actually hear about Ethereum and what was your
kind of first initial reaction to it?

SPEAKER_02 (Alex Van de Sande):
Sure. I—I have to say my wife thinks it's hilarious that
I'm old enough that my early work is being discovered by archaeologists now.
So I find it—I find it funny, a little bit weird, but it's—it's fun.

So
I—I think so I started
being interested in Bitcoin around
2012.
So that was
in
like—it feels like a long time ago. It feels like the early days, but for me, I—I already felt like, "Oh god. I missed it. They're already talking about Bitcoin on *The Good Wife* on—on live TV."
I’m like, "Oh, no." But, like, it—it used to be under a dollar. Now it's, like, $10.
Damn. I so missed Bitcoin. Right? That's too bad.

I—I even remember, like, I posted something on the forum saying, "Oh, no. I tried buying Bitcoin at $5. I paid.
It was so hard."
And then someone simply,
like—I think,
tipped me, like, 5 Bitcoin on Reddit saying, "Hey. Here's
here's your $5 worth of Bitcoin." And it was, like, back then, I don't know, like,
probably a full Bitcoin.
Right?
So, like, Bitcoin was $5 back then. So that was—that—that was those early days.
Again,
didn't feel too early.
And
then
I started paying attention because I felt that I knew someone bigger would come
after Bitcoin. And I just started following all sorts of projects,
like, Colored Coins and
MasterCoin and things like that.
And so I found Ethereum. And I was—wow. I was so blown away and captivated
that I couldn't think of anything else. The people were still very active on Reddit. Like, Vitalik would answer questions
personally.

And then I just started helping out on the forum, on Reddit.
I'm—I'm a designer. I'm not a coder. So I thought, "Hey. Like, there are enough coders here. Maybe they need—maybe a designer.” And then someone would ask something for a presentation I could give them.
And then by the time that the presale rolled around, they started
having cash, hiring people, and I was on the list. So that's how I got
started working with some—some crazy people.

SPEAKER_01:
So you did not, like, expect to be so heavily involved
and become the pioneer that you did. You were just kind of
jumping in and—and, you know, interested in this new opportunity, really. You didn't expect it to blow up like this.

SPEAKER_02 (Alex Van de Sande):
I certainly didn't expect it to—like, sort of yes and no, because I felt that back then,
it was—it seemed very obvious that Ethereum was going to be a big thing. And I was like, "I’m—I’m amazed that nobody else is paying attention to this." I was like, "Can't—can't you see? Look at this shit. This is—this is crazy. It's like a blockchain,
but it's a computer inside." And people were like—
think, like, people were acting as if it's crazy. Like, I—
I—I—I was a founder of a company back then. I—I was doing, like, an iPhone app, sort of, like, Instagram for fashion lists. And I had raised money with, like—but the—the app wasn't going anywhere. And I realized that I wasn't
using any of my spare brain cells to think about my iPhone app. I was just thinking about Ethereum all the time.
And then I told my friends that I—I wanted to leave this. They were like, "Are you, like, leaving the app you founded to work for a 19-year-old that's going to pay you in,
like, make-up money that he invented?"
I was like, "Yeah. Sure. That—that seems like a great idea."

SPEAKER_00:
Yeah. That—that's—that's—

SPEAKER_01:
Crazy, man. That’s honestly the—I mean, just your—your, you know, your belief in—in what this could turn out to be ended up leading you to such success and, you know, being a pioneer
in this space.

So when we talked before in the past, you told me you kinda helped assemble
the Mist Wallet development team. You explained you were part of, like, the hiring,
and you brought Fabian Vogelsteller on board. How did you go about, like, getting in touch with or finding Fabian to add to the team, and what made you so confident in his abilities?

I think you might have rugged there.
Can't hear you.
Is it just me, Mac? Can you hear him?

SPEAKER_02:
Alright. Let's see.

SPEAKER_00:
Alright. Good. I'm back. Yeah. Alright. Awesome.
Yeah. So

SPEAKER_01:
I don't even know where you left off.

SPEAKER_02:
I was talking about tokens.
Yeah. Talking about tokens. Yeah.
Am I the only one who couldn’t understand anything that Mac said because he was very distorted?

SPEAKER_01:
Yeah. He was a bit distorted. I don't know what's going on with that.
Okay. So
yeah. So you were talking about,
like, you know, Mastercoin
and those types of
projects, and you had to, like, you know, release a whole token and stuff. I was just—I was asking more about, like,
who decided to just, like,

SPEAKER_02:
play with the Mist token and just, oh, let's just give it away for free on Reddit. Like—oh, that's what I'm getting at. Right? So we knew tokens were important. And then at some point, I posted, like, we decided, hey, we want to do a token release on this.
And I posted on Reddit,
hey, let's talk about the coin
standard. Let's talk about something. There was a very interesting conversation
out of that. Based on that conversation,
Fabian [Vogelsteller] wrote
the
wrote, like, the ERC standard.
When we released the
and then when we released the new Mist Wallet, we wanted people to try it out because there were no tokens on Ethereum. Like, there was nothing you could tokenize.
So we basically released two tokens. One came with the wallet and was the unicorn thing—whenever you donated to the foundation, you got the unicorn.
And the other
that we wanted people to be able to play with for free was just, like,
something that Fabian created
literally for fun just using, like, the standard thing that they had. Mhmm. And then we just started giving away [the tokens] on Reddit just for people to try it out. Like,
nobody—nobody gave a lot of thought about it. It was just, this is the best thing that we wanted to try out and wanted people to play around with.

SPEAKER_01:
Of course, yeah. No. I—I get it. And in regards to the unicorn, the unicorn token was, like,
five, six months later though. Right? Is it?
Yeah. I mean, based on the contracts,
I don't know if it was, like—really? I didn't know—I don’t know if it was, like, talked about internally but not released until later. But yeah, it was released in 2016,
a couple months. I think it was two or three months.

SPEAKER_02:
And I—I think unicorns are great too, but, I mean, I—I—I can't—they’re really hard to get ahold of. So yeah, I mean, as you say, like, trust the timestamp. Right? I mean, like, if you were asking me, I would swear
that we released both of them at the same time when we released the tokens on the wallet.

SPEAKER_01:
Maybe we hadn’t that, like—yeah, you—I don’t think, yeah, you did. But the thing is that,
unicorn is actually like an ERC-20—
quote, unquote—actually an ERC-20 because Mist is basically an ERC-20 besides the approve function.
So it was like, that's why if you go look at the unicorns,
I’m pretty sure they have all of the
ERC-20 standard implemented,
whereas Mist is basically, like, the skeleton for it. You know? It’s just missing a few parts or one part, and then it would be considered a full ERC-20. But Fabian considers
it. I think you had a, you know, a good
outlook on exactly, you know, how it met the standard, except for the approve function.
But yeah. Yeah. That—that’s super, super interesting.

I was gonna say, was there anyone else that kinda helped
in,
like, whether it be, like, just ideating or actually getting in there and coding? Because I know you said you didn’t—you weren’t really a coder—that kinda helped with figuring out this ERC-20 standard? Was it really just Fabian? I know you mentioned Gavin Wood. I didn’t know if he was kinda
in the coding side of things too, or was it really just like Fabian when it comes to the actual coding part of it?

SPEAKER_02:
Well, we had a lot of feedback from the community in regards to how to build the tokens.
There were some projects—I think the guys from MakerDAO,
or—I think Rune [Rune Christensen] was already, like, participating in that. Rune from MakerDAO now.
He was already saying, look, we have this project, like—
and we already released a big number of tokens, and that—that was, like, they—they—they—they were working on that project they had. And, of course, there was no standard for that, and that’s sort of why we wanted, yeah, sure, you release a token, but that doesn’t mean that, like—it—we need a standard so that everyone can release tokens and those tokens can exist on wallets and things like that.

But I think
so Fabian basically got the feedback from the whole community as a whole. Mhmm. Like,
wrote the road standard,
and those things were very
participatory
projects. Right? So this—writing a standard is,
by design, something that you want to have the buy-in of the community. You want to have a lot of feedback
so that everyone can at some point just agree
on something. Right? So it’s not something that you just come out and say, hey, here’s how the foundation is going to do it. No. We—we wanna hear it, and we wanna make sure that everyone is following the standard.
Otherwise, it won’t be a standard. We’d just do something proprietary, and that misses the point.

SPEAKER_01:
Yeah.
Yeah.
That kinda leads me into my next question. Did you believe ERC-20
would
```

```
Electiva Foundation is I started working on a project,
which I called Unilogin,
which was another project that went nowhere.
But also, a lot of the ideas that were there are starting to come around, and I think those would be super important. Right?

And what I wanted to do on Unilogin,
what I wanted was for everyone to stop using private keys for their
crypto. Right? I thought
that private keys were something that wasn’t user-friendly
and that a user should never see.

And my point was, I think that everyone should have more wallets and that a private key should be something that your device creates
and never takes out of the device. And whenever you lost that device, you just replace it with another one.

And so I worked for two years on smart wallets, something like that.
Then, at some point,
we hit the wall where creating a smart wallet would cost you $500 or $100 just to acquire a new user. We had to close down the company.

But a lot of the ideas that I spent, like, two years talking about and trying to share
and trying to explain at conferences
are
now finally seeing fruition and things like that becoming real,
because people
are—like today, the term is account abstraction.

Right? And I think
it's still one of the most important things to happen if
we want blockchains to go mainstream.
It would be for users to never have to care about private keys again. Right? Where you just have a name,
and that name is connected to
a couple of multiple devices,
and
you basically use one device to allow you to use another. Right?

And I think we've,
and I think we are probably reaching a moment where this will be able to be done. Right? Now we have not only cheaper L2s that allow you to have more wallets,
but it's easier for you to
deploy and already have the address of a smart contract that can be deployed on all L2s at the same time. We have passkeys, which are a cryptographic standard that is accepted by
both Android and Apple devices,
which is
really great for logging in.

And I think it's,
like,
that's something I’m very happy to see growing in crypto.

Well, yes. I am proud of all the other achievements you mentioned.

SPEAKER_01 (Unidentified):
No. Yeah. That's actually really interesting because
I'm actually developing some stuff now, and my developer constantly talks to me about how big account abstraction is going to be for this next
bull run.
You know, bull run and stuff like that. And it’s really fascinating to hear that you were actually working on something like this a few years ago. Was it? Or, like, in 2018?

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. 2018 was the first time I even talked about that.

SPEAKER_01:
I think you were just ahead of your time, to be honest. You know? That is really because it’s huge when it comes to onboarding
new, like, users—quote, unquote "normies"—
because, like, nobody wants to have to store their private key and worry about all that nonsense.

And you were working on it back in 2018; it was just that maybe the space hadn’t matured enough then. Obviously, it wasn’t at a point where it is now. Damn, that sucks. I would really like to see, maybe,
Unilogin make a comeback.

SPEAKER_02 (Possibly Alex Van de Sande):
I’m pretty sure the things I wanted to function will exist.
I'm very happy to see it because I think it’s super important for
apps to reach the mainstream that we want them to reach.

SPEAKER_01:
Yeah. No. That’s great.

Taking it back to the beginning again,
what were, like, your guys' main challenges and considerations
when it came to the Mist Wallet and
the early development of it, especially in relation to the fact that Ethereum was so early
and still evolving?

What do you guys—you know—what do you think about that? What was your biggest
challenge or consideration you took into account when building it?

SPEAKER_02:
Oh.
I think that’s an interesting question that comes to the heart of what made the Mist Wallet and why it was doomed and why it failed.

One of the things we really wanted was to sort of reinvent
the way the web would work.
And we really wanted to make sure that
every user of the Mist Wallet was also a full node. Right? It was not only going to be a full node on Ethereum, but it was also going to be a
full node on Swarm, and every app there would be,
like, hosted on Swarm.

We didn’t even want you to be able to connect
to a traditional web, which we called it. Right? …

SPEAKER_01:
What you do a lot is just you're trying to communicate and convince people that this is a good thing worth building.

SPEAKER_01:
Yeah. That...yeah...that's...I appreciate that question, Mug, because even though
it's a bit of a situation with me, I'm dealing with the same thing when it comes to, you know, trying to find a healthy,
positive, collaborative environment
instead of, like, being at each other's necks and trying to figure out who's right or what's the best way to go. Sometimes collaborative effort, you know...and there needs to be a sense of positivity and realization that the end goal is the same for everybody.
You know, how we get there is, you know, that's how you work together and figure out what's the best way to approach that problem. You know, it's tough to work with teams, especially remote. You're not there to see people's reactions in person and judge body language. It's tough at times.

SPEAKER_02:
Yeah. And you have to listen. Right? If you feel that your ideas are pure
beauty and genius,
and that everyone is trying to ruin it, you're probably not a very good
team member. And probably your ideas aren't that great. Right? You have to have humility and understand that other people also have good ideas on how to improve your thing.

SPEAKER_01:
Yeah. I mean, and nowadays with this culture... I mean, some of these Crypto Twitter people and stuff like that, like,
there's a lot of arrogance where everybody thinks they know it all. And if you can't take a step back and see that you don't know it all—and you never will know it all—you know, you’re better off as a team because you can actually take that receptive criticism and those other ideas and mesh them into one, like you're saying. And now it's not just one idea; it's everybody's idea. And, you know, everybody put in the time and effort, so they, you know, all feel kinda emotionally connected to that idea. You know?
Yeah. No. That was a great question, Mug. Especially as I'm, you know, dealing with that stuff on my own building. It's really nice to hear something like that.

SPEAKER_02:
Can you hear me now, by any chance? I think we have, like...I think we have time for one last question. One last question.

SPEAKER_01:
Can you hear me well? Yeah. Yeah. We can hear you.
Do you wanna ask the final question? I was gonna try to—go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah. I'll be quick.

SPEAKER_04:
So I think you mentioned, Alex, that there were a lot of attempts to do,
you know,
essentially, on-chain wallets and stuff. I know that the EthSwarm team was working quite early on,
like Daniel A. Nagy and some other guys like Idan Shadrin, on an on-chain wallet called EthLogin or LoginEth.
Were you familiar with that one? It wasn't that early, but it was something that I also came across and did a little bit of work on probably two years ago. And, second small question:
the Parity Wallet came out just after Mist Wallet. Was that an attempt to solve the issue with the syncing of a whole node? Because I remember there were statements that they would try and run it on, like, a light client and only, you know, sync
portions of the chain.

SPEAKER_02:
So I worked with Daniel A. Nagy, if that's the same person. He was also on the Swarm team. Yeah. I don't remember his work on
LoginEth.
That's interesting.
Not sure what you mean by, like, on-chain wallets.
The Parity light client thing... Since I was working with Parity—and there were always, like, claims that, like, yeah, this light client sync or this, like, new light client sync is going to be the one that solves
all light client problems. Right? So there’s always... And, like,
we tried a lot of them. And I think
I still don't think there's...
And I still don't think there's a very
good way to really have a fully decentralized light client
that can just connect to it, right?
First of all,
because it's hard to do it. And often...
And what's even sadder is that often the user doesn't really care. That's always a big problem in software.
Often, the user... Like, if you say, look, instead of taking, like, one gigabyte or 10 gigabytes, this thing is going to take 100 megabytes.
And the user is like, why do I even wanna, like, use this 100 megabytes if I can just connect to Etherscan or, like, whatever?
And then...
that's never good enough for a user.
Yeah. Tough.
So, yeah. "The user didn't care" is
like an epitaph for a thousand
decentralized projects everywhere.

SPEAKER_04:
Awesome. Thank you for answering that. I tagged you in a comment with the repo that I was talking about. And, yes, it was Daniel A. Nagy from Swarm. I did a bit of work with him two years ago.

SPEAKER_01:
Alex, I got one question for you just so you have time to plug what you're working on. I saw that you’re working on a new project called the High-Order Company.
Can you explain to us a bit about what that is, what the goals are, and just, you know, talk about what you're currently working on? And after that, I just, you know, appreciate your time and stuff.

SPEAKER_02:
Sure.
I am working
on two fronts. I am working a lot on ENS, on meta-governance for ENS and DAOs in general. I think it's super important to think about governance. And I still think that one of the main impacts that blockchain can have today
is to
have decentralized
companies or organizations
where all the funds are trackable and everything is transparent. And I'm very proud to see that ENS is—I would say—one of the best examples of that.

or something. I don't know. That's what I was gonna ask him about. Was like, who kind of thought about sending that? So,
there's actually
some crazy signers on there, like Alex.
Don't know. I think Fabian,
but Vitalik is on there as a signer.
Like, there's a lot of big names on there as signers. If we could somehow
get
the attention of enough signers to go ahead and unlock that 50
that 50k Mistcoin, we could have okay. Here's Victor. Hold on one second.
We could have potentially
enough to bridge over to Base, maybe do a little bit of, like, DAO incentive things because there is a DAO for Mistcoin that I set up via Snapshot,
and then go ahead and maybe pay out some developers for building cool things on top of Mist. Like, that 50k would be very, very valuable if we could somehow
snatch it up. But so, what's going on, Victor? Oh, yeah. My bad.

VICTOR:
No. You're good. Yes,

AUSTIN:
Austin. First of all, congratulations for this initiative. I think that's great. Please keep it up because I think that this last Monday
session is something that we need to keep doing. Secondly, about the liquidity on Base. Just remember, guys, that Uniswap
pools are permissionless.
No? So everybody's free to pool their own liquidity. And at the end of the day, I mean, if everybody,
let's say, pools, like, 10% of their holdings of Mist or 5% or just a tiny amount, at the end, the liquidity there will be healthier, and we will progressively
be building more liquidity on Base. You know? I mean, maybe now we don't have too much volume there because the liquidity is tiny, so nobody would be interested in trading there. No. But it's something like
progressively. You know? The more people pooling liquidity there, the more volume we will have and eventually more exposure. So I think that maybe waiting for releasing these tokens of DogeDAO, maybe it will take time. So maybe we can do this, come in with an effort of providing some liquidity by ourselves.
Not that well, you know, the gas fees now on the mainnet are very low. So, well, I think that everybody can afford to do a swap on mainnet because, well, the gas this morning, I guess, was $7.06 or something like that. So it's
not too expensive.

SPEAKER_04:
Do you know who created the Base-side
Mistcoin?
Essentially, the bridge.

VICTOR:
Yeah. It's me, but well, there is a tool on Base called Base Mirror. So everybody is free to do that. It's very simple. It's just two or three steps, and you have, like, a tutorial developed by the Base guys. So everybody's free to do the same with any Ethereum-based token. It just takes, like, thirty minutes to do the whole process, and later on, like, five, six days to have the pull request on GitHub approved.

SPEAKER_04:
Yeah. Yeah. I actually was speaking about the earlier
space, saying how Base is really,
really popping off and how L2s have made it really, really easy for
lots of different use cases.
But surely we don't need liquidity
for Mist tokens unless they want to bridge back
from
Base to Ethereum. Right? Because if you want it—well, it depends on how the bridge is set up. But if you're bridging from Ethereum mainnet to Base, you essentially
mint a new token on the Base side. And
in that way, you could basically
it's
ready for you. So anybody who wants to bridge from Ethereum just bridges, and it mints the new token on Base. But, obviously, bridging it back from
Base
to Ethereum would require more liquidity.

SPEAKER_01:
Yeah. I think it locks up—it it locks up that Mist, and that's why it's only one specific bridge. I don't think there are multiple bridges. So if you lock your Mist in that contract,
it mints the Base token, and then you put that Base token back in there, and it unlocks
the Mist at that amount and stuff like that.

SPEAKER_04:
The supply can only be as high as how many tokens are locked in that initial Ethereum bridge. Yeah. So the liquidity is just that—we want liquidity just in case we wanna bridge back from Base.
Anybody who has Mist can just go ahead and bridge across.

VICTOR:
Yes. Yeah. I was referring just to the liquidity in Uniswap just in case you want to do some swaps from the Mist on Base to Ethereum Mist. Just that. As
I was saying, you don't need liquidity on both sides for the bridge to work in such a way that once you bridge one token from mainnet to the Base side, I mean, it's locked.

SPEAKER_04:
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
we need more liquidity providers.

SPEAKER_03:
I have a suggestion. Right? Uh-huh. What does everybody think about
maybe
because, you know, there's, like, a meme mania right now,
and people are throwing their money at all types of
I mean, pretty much nonsense.
Right? Mhmm. And this narrative that we're looking at right now, we're dealing with this—it pretty much
it sells itself. I'm just speaking from an investor standpoint. Right? So if liquidity is the goal...
what does everybody think about
maybe
us,
ourselves? Instead of waiting for the Doge...
unlocking that 50k Mist would be good.
But instead of waiting,
or while we wait on that,
I mean, something that we could possibly do—if everybody's up for it—is maybe start,
I don't know, maybe our own token or something...

So it would be nice to get, you know, another chain functional with, you know, cheaper gas.

SPEAKER_03:
And people like me. People love me.

SPEAKER_01:
Yeah. No. Base is... I have some questions about Base on, you know, some things they said, like, you know, if something did go down, I think they would bend the knee to the SEC. And if you don't fucking
give up your information, you won't be able to bridge out or something like that. It's always a possibility.

SPEAKER_03:
Yeah. I see them hand out Wells notices and stuff. Like, I've been seeing that. I don't even know what that is, but it's probably, like...

The Wells notice? Yeah.
Oh, it's just pretty much like
in layman's terms, it's kinda like a forewarning
of
or like a chance.
That's like that's like what the SEC gives companies, like, "Hey, just just a heads up, we figure you're doing something that falls out of bounds of the law, and this is your chance, so this is your acknowledgment."
This is your chance to realize we're on you pretty much or, like, something's coming.

SPEAKER_04:
It's not an official charge. It's just kinda like a notice. Yeah. They're essentially saying they're saying that, you know, "We are coming. We are going to take you to court for x and y, and you should start
preparing your defense." Right? Prepare.

SPEAKER_03:
So it's intent... it intends to prosecute. With Robinhood, I've seen it with some other exchanges. So what you just said about Base, yes, that is also something that we should think about,
you know,
focusing too much of our eggs in that Base basket.
I just figured Base... only because of the popularity, but yes, that is also a concern that I think about as well. I mean... Yeah, Base...

SPEAKER_04:
Base is pretty safe,
purely because it is Coinbase, and Coinbase has actually
gone through the rigmarole
with the SEC. I think that it may... it could be... there could be more right now, but it's like Coinbase is, like, the only one that's
is, like, backed. Like, it's fair to say that it's insured, essentially.
So they went through that whole process, which is good.
But
yeah. I mean, if you didn't know, Joe Lubin from ConsenSys is actually taking the SEC to court because of all these Wells notices to different companies, like Uniswap.

SPEAKER_01:
What's wrong? Gary didn't, you know, didn't get the job at Binance, so now he's all salty and just throwing notices at everybody.
Fucking... I can't... I have no...
