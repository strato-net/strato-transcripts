SPEAKER_00 (Host):**
What's going on, everybody? Uh, Alex, I sent you an invite to speak and cohost.
If you have any questions, just let me know. You can DM me.
Good to see the faces piling in. Got a lot of good questions here. Can't wait to talk about just the rich history here.
Here. There we go.

Alex, good to have you here, man. Appreciate it.
If anybody else wants to come up later and ask any questions, just feel free to raise your hand.

**SPEAKER_01 (Mac):**
Kinda.
Kinda a bit, like, underwater.

**SPEAKER_00 (Host):**
Is Victor out here? No. Victor. Okay.
Let me see. Just give us a few moments, guys, trying to set this up. Appreciate your patience. Technology.

Cartoons, you wanna come up? I'll invite you.
Even if you're just on a panel, you don't gotta speak. You are here for episode zero, so...

But you got you, Mac. Wishing my phone wasn't so dumb. I'd DJ some stuff here instead of this silence.

**SPEAKER_02 (Alex Van de Sande):**
You should sing, AG.

**SPEAKER_00 (Host):**
Who's—who said that? Alex? Hey.

**SPEAKER_02 (Alex Van de Sande):**
Hey. You should play some live music.

**SPEAKER_01 (Mac):**
I—I—I was playing some classical music, but, yeah, I don't know. It's—it's good to have you on here.

I'm glad the mic's all working out now. I really appreciate you jumping on. It's been an interesting six months for sure.

So, really, I just wanna kinda pick your brain a bit about the past, honestly. Like, more than just, you know, Mist Wallet in general, but really just, like, how you got all started with, you know, the Ethereum Foundation and whatnot.

So, like, when did you actually hear about Ethereum, and what was your kind of first initial reaction to it?

**SPEAKER_02 (Alex Van de Sande):**
Sure. I—I have to say, my wife thinks it's hilarious that I'm old enough that my early work is being discovered by archaeologists now.

So I find it—I find it funny, a little bit weird, but it's—it's fun.

So I—I think I started being interested in mining Bitcoin around 2012. So that was, like, it feels like a long time ago. It feels like the early days, but for me, I—I already felt like, "Oh God, I missed it."

They're already talking about Bitcoin on *The Good Wife* on, like, live TV. I was like, "Oh, no." It used to be under a dollar. Now it's $10. Damn. I so missed Bitcoin. Right? That's too bad.

I even remember, like, I posted something on the forum saying, "Oh, no. I tried buying Bitcoin at $5." It was so hard. And then someone, like, tipped me 5 Bitcoin on Reddit saying, "Hey, here's your $5 worth of Bitcoin." And it was, like, back then, I don't know, probably a full Bitcoin. Right? So, like, Bitcoin was $5 back then. So, that—that was those early days.

Again, didn't feel too early.

And then I started paying attention because I felt that I knew something bigger would come for Bitcoin. And I just started following all sorts of projects, like Mastercoin and things like that.

And so I found Ethereum, and I was, wow, so blown away and captivated that I couldn't think of anything else. And the people were still very active on the Reddit and would answer questions personally.

And then I just started helping out on the forum, on the Reddit. I'm—I'm a designer. I'm not a coder. So I thought, "Hey, like, there are enough coders here. Maybe they need a designer."

And then someone would ask for something for a presentation that I could give them.

And then, by the time the presale rolled around, they started having cash, hiring people, and I was on the list. So that's how I got started working with some crazy people.

**SPEAKER_01 (Mac):**
So you did not, like, expect to be so heavily involved and become the pioneer that you did. You were just kind of jumping in and, you know, interested in this new opportunity, really. You didn't expect it to blow up like this.

**SPEAKER_02 (Alex Van de Sande):**
I certainly didn't expect it to—like, sort of yes and no—because I felt that back then, it seemed very obvious that Ethereum was going to be a big thing, and I was like, "I'm amazed that nobody else is paying attention to this."

I was like, "Can't you see? Look at this! This—this is crazy. It's like a blockchain, but it's a computer inside."

And people were like—people were acting like I was crazy.

Like, I—I was a founder of a company back then. I was doing, like, an iPhone app—sort of like Instagram for fashion lists—and I had raised money. But the app wasn't going anywhere, and I realized that I wasn't using any of my spare brain cells to think about my iPhone app. I was just thinking about Ethereum all the time.

And then I told my friends that I—I wanted to leave this. They were like, "Are you, like, leaving the app you founded to work for a 19-year-old that's going to pay you in, like, made-up money that he invented?"

I was like, "Yeah. Sure. That—that seems like a great idea."

**SPEAKER_00 (Host):**
Yeah. That’s—that’s...

**SPEAKER_01 (Mac):**
...crazy, man. That’s honestly the—I mean, just your—your, you know, your belief in what this could turn out to, ended up leading you to such, you know, success and a pioneer—you know, being a pioneer in this space.

So, when we talked before in the past, you told me you kinda helped assemble the Mist Wallet development team. You explained you were part of, like, the hiring, and you brought Fabian Vogelsteller on board.

How did you go about, like, getting in touch with or finding Fabian to add to the team, and what made you so confident in his abilities?

**SPEAKER_02 (Alex Van de Sande):**
So, when I started working—

So the first person I started talking about working was with Gavin Wood. Gavin was the one who sort of introduced me to the idea of making a browser.

I would say that, really, my—the way I got to work was that I downloaded what was, like, the latest client—CPP, the C++ client—and then it was called AlethZero.

And if you ever, you should try to Google how that looked like because it—felt like the cockpit of an Airbus with lots of small windows showing all sorts of buttons and settings you had to push. It was super complex.

But I still looked at it and said, "Woah, this is like a fantastic app. I wish it was simpler to use."

SPEAKER_01:**
Literally, for fun, just using, like, the standard thing that they had. Mhmm. And then just started giving it away on Reddit just for people to try it out. Like, nobody gave a lot of thought about it. It was just, this is the best thing that we wanted to try out and wanted people to play around with.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Of course.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. No, I get it. And in regards to the unicorn, the Unicorn token was, like...

**SPEAKER_02:**
Five, six months later though. Right? Is it?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I mean, based on the contracts...

**SPEAKER_02:**
I don't know if it was, like... Really? I didn’t know... I don’t know if it was, like, talked about internally but not released until later. But, yeah, it was released in 2016, a couple of months. I think it was two or three months.

**SPEAKER_01:**
And I think Unicorns are great too, but, I mean, I can’t... they’re very hard to get ahold of. So, yeah. I mean, as you say, like, trust the timestamp. Right? I mean, like, if you were asking me, I would swear...

**SPEAKER_02:**
That we released both of them at the same time when we released the tokens on the wallet.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Maybe you hadn't. Like, yeah, I don’t think, yeah, you did. But the thing is that Unicorn is actually like an ERC-20, quote-unquote, actually an ERC-20 because Mist is basically an ERC-20 besides the `approve` function.

**SPEAKER_02:**
So it was like that's why if you go look at the Unicorns, I’m pretty sure they have all of the ERC-20 standard implemented, whereas Mist is basically like the skeleton for it, you know? It’s just missing a few parts or one part, and then it would be considered a full ERC-20. But Fabian considers it...

**SPEAKER_01:**
I think you had a good outlook on exactly, you know, how it met the standard besides the `approve` function. But yeah. Yeah. That’s super, super interesting.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Mhmm.

**SPEAKER_01:**
I was gonna say, was there anyone else that kinda helped, like, whether it be just ideating or actually getting in there and coding? Because I know you said you weren’t really a coder. Did anyone help with figuring out this ERC-20 standard? Was it really just Fabian? I know you mentioned Gavin Wood. I didn’t know if he was kinda involved with the actual coding part of it?

**SPEAKER_02:**
Well, we had a lot of feedback from the community in regards to how to build the tokens. There were some projects—I think the guys from MakerDAO—or, I think Rune Christensen was already participating on that. Rune from MakerDAO now.

He was already saying, look, we have this project, and we’ve already released a big number of tokens. And they were already, like, claiming, oh, their token... they were working on that project. And, of course, there was no standard for that. And that’s sort of why we wanted to do it.

Sure, you release a token, but that doesn’t mean... like, we need a standard so that everyone can release tokens and those tokens can exist on wallets and things like that. So Fabian basically got the feedback from the community as a whole, wrote the standard, and...

**SPEAKER_01:**
Mhmm.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Those things were very participatory. Writing a standard is, by design, something where you want the buy-in of the community. You want to have a lot of feedback so that everyone can, at some point, just agree on something. Right?

It’s not something that you just come out and say, hey, here’s how the Foundation is going to do it. No. We wanted to hear from the community and make sure that everyone followed the standard. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be a standard. We didn’t want it to just be proprietary.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
That kinda leads me into my next question. Did you believe ERC-20 would kind of achieve this relevance and be as big as it is here, like, ten years later? Or did you expect a better, newer standard to come around?

**SPEAKER_02:**
We knew the tokens were super important for Ethereum. Back when we were working on the Mist Wallet, basically, all other crypto wallets, especially every other Ethereum wallet, had one function in mind: you got the wallet, took the Ether you got from the presale, and sent it to an exchange to sell it.

Or you bought something on an exchange and sent it to yourself. That was the only reason anyone would use a wallet. There were already a lot of wallets back then, and all of them were just that—a way for you to sell or store Ether.

We wanted to fix that. We knew that if we wanted people to use Ethereum as we envisioned, we needed to create new functions. We needed to invent cool, new things that people wanted to work with. That’s why tokens were really important for us.

Did I expect ERC-20 to be big? Here’s something funny I didn’t expect. We really expected tokens themselves to be important. I didn’t expect the term “ERC-20” to be as big as it is.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Haha.

**SPEAKER_02:**
To the point that Bitcoin tokens are now known as “BRC-20,” which is sort of laughable because it wasn’t the 20 of anything. Right? 20 doesn’t mean tokens. Twenty was just a random number that happened to be the order in which Fabian asked the questions on Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).

Suddenly, “BRC-20” becomes the center. I think that’s hilarious.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I mean, that’s imitation being the sincerest form of flattery.

**SPEAKER_02:**
Exactly.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Even though those BRC-20s don’t even have smart contracts or anything remotely similar to ERC-20 tokens, it’s a totally different kind of tech. It just pays homage to how important ERC-20 was to the development of Ethereum.

You’re a pioneer. You and everyone involved created something amazing. Even though the Mist Wallet was sunsetted, the mark you left on cryptocurrency and blockchain is tremendous. It’s honestly nuts, and it’s crazy that you weren’t even expecting it to have that much...

**SPEAKER_02:**
Let me say something because you keep calling me a pioneer...
```

```plaintext
SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. No. That's—that's great. Taking a little bit back to the beginning again, what was, like, your guys' main challenges and considerations when it came to the Mist Wallet and, uh, the early development of it? Especially in relation to the fact that Ethereum was so early and it was still evolving. What do you guys—what do you think about that? What was your biggest, you know, uh, maybe challenges and considerations you took into place when you were building?

ALEX VAN DE SANDE:**
Oh, I think that—I think that is an interesting question that comes to the heart of what made the—the Mist Wallet what it was, and why it was doomed and why it failed. Right? One of the things we really wanted was that we sort of wanted to reinvent the way the web would work.

And we really wanted to make sure that every user of the Mist Wallet was also a full node. Right? It was going to be a full node on Ethereum; it was also going to be a full node on Swarm. And every app there would be, like, hosted on Swarm. We didn't even want it to connect to a traditional web, which we called the "old web." Right? The idea was that every app you would load—if you loaded an ENS name—would connect to a Swarm node, and that would download your app directly from other Mist Wallet users. And, also, you'd be running an Ethereum full node so that you're never dependent on anything.

I think we were very—let's say—not very pragmatic about it because the reality was that it worked for a few years. In 2015, 2016, it was possible for you to run a full node on your desktop. But the reality is that by 2017, when one of the first really big major full bull runs started happening, it would already take, like, hours and hours between downloading and actually having the wallet work. And then almost all users had already migrated to MetaMask, which is just instant. Right?

You download it. You don't need to download a new browser because it works in the browser you already like. It connects directly to something like Infura or Etherscan, so you don't need to worry about a full node. You connect directly to the traditional web, so you don't need to worry about storing your webpage or anything like that.

In the end, that's why I think one of the main reasons Mist failed was because we were sort of dreaming too much in a way. Right? We wanted everyone to run a full node and for everyone to run a fully decentralized web, and that just wasn't practical then and still isn't fully feasible today. That's sort of how the project, and the company around it, ultimately ended up with no users. We had to shut it down—one of the main reasons.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. That was one of my questions towards the end. I was gonna ask why you guys actually decided to sunset it, but that makes sense because, you know, it is hard to get some people to interact on that level if they have to create a node and make sure the node is running correctly and everything. Like, that just kinda steers some of the less technical people away.

ALEX VAN DE SANDE:**
We were able to abstract over that technical side of creating a node. Like, you didn't know you were running a node. You—you didn't really know you were creating anything like that—you were just uploading or using the wallet. But the problem with trying to abstract a lot of this design is that you can make a lot of things feel like magic, and that's what we wanted to do.

But there’s a point where you hit a technical roadblock. For most users, that came when we'd tell them, "Look, it's going to take you five hours or six hours—or maybe a full week—before you can even use this app." Right? And there’s no way to abstract anything over that.

I remember actually spending hours and hours trying to work on the right loading animation to make sure that little bar felt like it was loading faster than it actually was. But there’s no design that can fix that when it actually will take a week. Right? The animation can look fancy, and it can have a lot of cute aspects, but it’s still going to take a week. There’s no way to mask that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
There’s no putting lipstick on that page. Yeah. I think Mac was talking about that earlier in the earlier space. Mac, you can come up and say something if your mic sounds alright.

**SPEAKER_Mac:**
Nope. Nope. Not gonna say anything? Okay. Sounds good. I’ll go to my next question.

**SPEAKER_03:**
I got a question to ask. Oh, okay. Yeah. Go ahead, brother.

Yeah. Uh, how’s everybody doing? Good. Good. Good. Glad to have you up here. You know me as Magician, but you guys can just call me Mud. Um, I have a question for Alex. I was gonna ask—you actually answered another question I posted in the Telegram—was what was your biggest concern, uh, as far as development, like, how to get or onboard the next billion users? And I think you kinda touched on it. You said account abstraction, if I’m not mistaken.

Um, another question I wanted to ask was, what’s your biggest lesson that you’ve learned on a personal level as far as finding that balance between doing the work—like, putting your head down and just enveloping yourself into your ideas and pushing them forward—and working with a team? Like, how—what’s your biggest lesson you’ve learned in trying to push an idea you believe in while also being receptive to other people's ideas and actually trying to find a way to make others see your vision?

ALEX VAN DE SANDE:**
That is a great question because I think that is—it’s how we work with a team. Right? I think the best work I’ve ever done—and, like, I’ve been working with remote teams for over ten years right now—we were doing remote teams way before Zoom was a thing and way before COVID forced remote work. We did it because there was no other way to get people from all over the world to work on a single project without flying everyone to one location. Right?

We had to work remotely. Part of working remotely is that you have this significant amount of time where it’s just you alone working—no one over your shoulder to check on you. But then you also have to stop and have deep conversations with people.

Those conversations—they’re not about you pushing your idea or accepting someone else’s and declaring whoever wins. It’s about finding common ground. Right? I think in those discussions, the ideas improve drastically. Often, what happened is I'd have an idea, and Fabian Vogelsteller would have a different idea. We’d argue intensely about it—he’d bring arguments, I’d counter them. Then he’d counter my changes with his own solutions. By the end, the back-and-forth often resulted in a solution neither of us had initially envisioned, but we eventually realized was stronger and more effective than either original idea.

I think Steve Jobs used the term, "Strong opinions, loosely held," and I think it fits here. You must be passionate and firm about your beliefs, but also willing to release them if you see a genuinely better idea emerge.

**SPEAKER_03:**
It’s interesting. Uh, thank you for the answer you gave. You actually answered a few questions I had in mind. Um, I think it’s very important information for anyone promoting or pushing forward an idea but also trying to work collaboratively in a team.

ALEX VAN DE SANDE:**
Yeah, for sure. And thinking about that—I think it's always important. Right? A lot of my work—even as a designer—has been focused on helping developers articulate what they envision and translating it into something users can understand. Often, I found myself communicating users' needs back to the developers. It’s a two-way translation. If developers want to build something confusing, I try to translate that complexity into clarity for end-users. I advocate for them, saying, "This is the user experience we should aim for."

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. That’s… I appreciate that question, Mud—it’s a similar situation for me. Working with teams remotely, it can be hard without in-person context to build a positive, collaborative environment focused on problem-solving.
```

Here is the corrected transcript with the requested edits:**

---

**SPEAKER_01**:**
Can you explain to us a bit about what that is, you know, what the goals are, and just, you know, talk about what you're currently working on? And after that, I just, you know, appreciate your time and stuff.

**SPEAKER_02** (Alex Van De Sande):**
Sure. Uh, I am working both on two fronts. I am working a lot on ENS, on meta-governance for ENS and for DAOs in general. I think it's super important to think about governance. And I still think that one of the main impacts that blockchain can have today is to enable decentralized companies or organizations where all the funds are trackable and everything is transparent. And I'm very proud to see that ENS is, I would say, one of the best examples of that.

The second thing I work a lot on is—I mean, one of the smartest people I've worked with during my time with the Foundation, and I'm not saying this lightly because I did work with a lot of smart people, was a guy named Victor. Victor Maia—he goes by Victor Tyler right now. He worked on the Mist Wallet, and I would often ask him to do a task, like, "Hey, can you just integrate this library with Swarm for a bit?" And two or three days later, he'd come back, "Yeah, the work is done, but I need more time because I found an upstream bug in the library." And then three days later, he'd be like, "Yeah, I fixed the library, but I think the library's having the wrong approach. Give me a few days. I'm gonna make a new library for that."

And then I gave him a few days more, and he was like, "You know, I've created a new library, but I think the real problem is that Mist is using the wrong thing. We should really refactor Mist as a whole to do the thing." And at some point, I joked with him, "Victor, I can't give you more time. I know that if you just had all the time in the world, you’d just want to build a whole new computer." And he was like, "Yeah, you're right. I would." Well, guess what? Victor has all the time in the world now, and he's actually building a new computer.

He just figured out a way to—like, he's been studying computer science history, and he found a way to create a new type of computer architecture that’s much more parallel and can execute faster, and a lot of things like that. And I think it's fantastic. It's one of those things that are very hard to communicate what they’re doing, but I think they’re doing something that is going to be big.

Part of what I work on there is just trying to explain to people what they are doing. Right? And we're working on a new website—it’s going to be very cool. You’re going to be able to see some animations. Within essence, you know, like, we are all using Turing machines. And Victor's like, "Look, Turing machines are wrong. There are better ways to do computation instead of having this concept of a Turing machine, which is like a little robot with infinite tape that goes back and forth and changes the tape from zero to one."

Instead, he is able to turn any sort of computation basically into a planar graph with a thousand lines. And those lines have four little commands that they can do, and they can do all at the same time. So you can run it on 8, 16 cores at the same time, and it just becomes a very easy way to transform any computation into something that is multicore all the time. So, yeah, you should—if you think this sounds interesting, you should definitely follow the HVM page.

**SPEAKER_01**:**
How do I profit off this? How do I invest in this?

**SPEAKER_02** (Alex Van De Sande):**
Well, you should follow us. If you want to be a pioneer yourself—

**SPEAKER_01**:**
Maybe you can participate in that somehow. Right? I would like to be a pioneer like you, Alex. I really would. Is that the High-Order Company, or is that something else? Yeah. Okay. I'm definitely going to, um, check that out and do some research into it because that sounds amazing, and it sounds like the guy you’ve got on board is definitely one of those genius pioneers that you don’t come across very often. So yeah, you should definitely follow up.

Yeah. I'm going to look into that. I wholeheartedly really appreciate you, Alex, jumping on here. Maybe we could do it again sometime because I still have, like, 20 other questions I want to ask you. But—and I know there are other people here too that wanted to come up, but it’s been about an hour, and, you know, I don’t want to take too much of your time. So thank you so much, and I really, truly, truly do appreciate it.

**SPEAKER_02** (Alex Van De Sande):**
Well, thank you for the invitation, and it was fun to have this conversation.

**SPEAKER_01**:**
Yeah, man. Have a good day.

Let me know if you'd like further clarity or adjustments! Tasks like associating more names with dialogue require additional context, so unknown speaker labels like **SPEAKER_01** remain for now. I preserved the structure, terminology validations, and relevant name edits specified.

Unfortunately, I cannot determine names from the provided context, as the raw transcript does not include clear indicators of speaker identity. Consequently, I will preserve the generic speaker labels and make corrections based on your guidelines. Here’s the revised transcript:**

---

**SPEAKER_01:**
This is actually, I don't, I mean, just—I don't know how the mechanics would work, but essentially that's how, like, the experience would go. Like, we're all in on it. We know what's up, we're already doing what we can. I see a few of us are already, you know, reposting stuff and posting memes and doing what we can to, like, you know, get it out there and get attention and market it, and that's, like, amazing.

But just an idea, you know, just so we can get some, like, new money in, and we can actually use that for something and, as a community, we all agree. You know what I mean? Mhmm. Full transparency, no rug bullshit.

I don't know, just something to think about. It's maybe—it sounds gimmicky, but I don't know. Sometimes gimmicks work and, you know, people always want to put their money in things. So that's just where my head was at. I would, I would just caution against creating a new token willy-nilly because, you know...

**SPEAKER_04:**
A lot of people forget, there's a lot of legal things that come into it, you know. So, like, you—legal, it's good. You could kind of say you're just splintering liquidity.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yes.

**SPEAKER_04:**
No, no, no, not just that. It's regulation, right? So if, you know, to launch a token the proper way, you have to make sure that, like, you, you know, understand the legalities in different jurisdictions because a lot of people just don't do this because they're like, "Whatever." But, you know, it can really come back to bite you in the ass if, you know, like, "Hey, you launched a token," and then, you know, the SEC comes knocking or—and remember, you're opening yourself up to every single jurisdiction because it's blockchain unless you actually say you can't trade this token in these jurisdictions.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Like, you know, certain platforms, as an American, you can't even use it. I see where you're going with it. And that's definitely something that would be at the forefront—the legality of it—because, you know, nobody really has time to deal with that.

**SPEAKER_01:**
What I was thinking is, not doing it properly, I should say. If we could, I mean, I kind of am starting this with, like, my Blockchain Historical Society and stuff. We're trying to get our hands on old relics and then potentially using those as, like, a reward system for supplying liquidity or something like that.

Like, there's a lot of different ways we can go about it and still kind of not launch our own token but find a way to reward those that add liquidity. There's a lot of different ways about things. And I've actually reached out to some people and got ahold of, via just really digging into the blockchain, some old developers that were launching tokens and stuff like that.

It could be NFTs. It could be a lot of different things. For example, a buddy of mine—his name's like tscurver or something like that on Twitter—he wrapped a bunch of XCOPY NFTs into ERC-20 tokens, and they're pretty, yeah, they're pretty big. I mean, his—last time I checked—his market cap was, like, anywhere between, like, $5 to $10 million. And it's just, he just wrapped old—or not old, but—art from XCOPY in it. And just because XCOPY is like a historical artist that has a big following, like, it makes it easier to trade it rather than like an NFT and stuff.

**SPEAKER_03:**
A fractional? Like, somebody could get a fractional amount of that?

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah, they could. I think you can as well. But it's something that I feel like people in the community would really bite and go for just because it has to do with, like, Mist. So, the legality thing of, like, an actual token, I agree with that. But something else—anything—that could, like, make people who are already invested in this feel like, you know, they're a part of something or they got exclusive access to something because they're a holder.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Right. Exactly.

**SPEAKER_01:**
It starts there. And then from there, we build out.

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah. No. More liquidity, attention, and liquidity. Education.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Well, I think a good way to be able to rep that you had owned Mist could be smart, whether it be a PFP or something like that. Like, see how you guys were talking about those badges earlier?

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah, back in the day. Badges.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Same thing with, like, the guy from Bankless. Like, how, with the POAP—you know, the Proof of Attendance Protocol?

**SPEAKER_03:**
Yeah, yeah.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Things like that. You know what I'm saying? Like, something similar to that.

SPEAKER_01:**
So if we were able to get our hands on some of them and just, like, give them out for free—not even necessarily, like, set a value behind it or anything—or, you know, even make a liquidity pool, it's still... you're getting these old, you know, relic tokens.

You know, at some point, somebody would probably make a pool and do a whole bunch of stuff, start an initiative, and grow a community—just like we did with Mist. You know? Like, that's what's amazing about this. Anybody could step up and do anything for whatever token it may be, whether it's an actual token that's a relic or something that was innovative at the time.

Maybe it's not 2017. Maybe it's not 2018. Or, you know, maybe it's 2019. Maybe it's 2020. Like, that's still, like, you know, four or five years ago. The space was much different then than it is now. I mean, look at Uniswap—it came around in 2020, and that was one of, you know, probably one of the greatest crypto-related tech advancements of our time.

The fact that liquidity pools could be made and anybody could trade any token without needing much liquidity behind it—that was huge. And that was just created in 2020. If you really think about it, we are still so early in the tech development of blockchain.

At some point, with account abstraction, you're going to get to a point where you're using crypto—and you don't even know you're using it. You know? It's like... And that's when we're going to see "normies," you know, normal people start to get involved. They're not even going to know that they're using crypto, but on the back end, they are.

And then that's when you're going to see the explosion. That's when you're still going to see Bitcoin hitting half a million, a million dollars because adoption is there. You know?

**SPEAKER_04:**
I mean, is this turning into now? There was Bancor and 0x Protocol in 2017.

So, I mean, they were on-chain swapping facilities for a long time. But Uniswap just— Don't fudge me, dude.

**SPEAKER_00:**
No, no, no.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Points. I'm not fudging. What I'm saying is that Uniswap just... Uniswap just did it really, really well. You know what I mean?

They really did a great job, and one thing that they did was they had their code open source. They also, what do you call it... they iterated really, really quickly with V2. They really did something, though, that was quite different.

**SPEAKER_00:**
Yeah, they innovated.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Yeah. For sure.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. I'm excited about Uniswap V4 too with the whole hooks thing and everything. Like, I was thinking about how to build on top of the hooks. I'm not a developer—I just kind of think of things in development ways and try to figure out a way to make cool stuff.

But Uniswap—they did their thing for sure, and, yeah, they definitely changed the game.

0x had liquidity pools like that? I thought they just had, like, straight-up DEXs.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Bancor, 0x... I think in the early days, I think 0x did have—

**SPEAKER_01:**
I don't know, dude. I think Uniswap made the LP. I think Uniswap came up with the liquidity pool idea.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Yeah, you might be right.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Because I remember trading on, like, dYdX, which used 0x, I’m pretty sure. And that was, like, 2019.

That was, like, when all the burn tokens came out—which I think there's actually, you know, potentially some opportunity there—and stuff, like deflationary tokens, you know, with this whole inflationary thing going on.

But yeah. No. It's been a crazy past—I've been in the game for, like, eight, nine years. It's crazy to see how far it's come.

But, um, I think that if anybody is interested and wants to make a Telegram group, please message me on Telegram at @ascensionguide. I'm in the chat all the time and posting, so just shoot me a PM.

I'll make a Mist Mondays private Telegram where we could talk about, you know, potential topics or maybe special guests or what we could do.

And, you know, I really think that Mist Mondays could be built up to have a lot of listeners in the future, especially as Mist Coin grows and gets more people in front of it.

This is the space to come and talk, shoot the shit, you know—potentially bring on other partners or whatever it may be—and just continue to grow this relic space.

Because the more that the relic space grows, the bigger an opportunity it is for Mist.

So, I'm probably going to wrap it up there, guys. Anybody that, you know, wants to shoot me a PM, you're more than welcome.

I appreciate everybody jumping on. I think Alex had a lot of great things to say.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Yeah. I'm excited for the future.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Appreciate you, man.

**SPEAKER_04:**
Thanks for the time, bro.

**SPEAKER_01:**
Yeah. For sure. I'll see you guys potentially next Monday. I want to do this every Monday, but at the very least, every couple Mondays.

I'll keep everybody posted in the chat and Mist Telegram.

And, yeah, we'll talk there. Thanks, everybody.
