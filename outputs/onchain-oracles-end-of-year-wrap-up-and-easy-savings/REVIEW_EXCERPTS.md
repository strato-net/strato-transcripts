> That's actually a little bit starting to happen in crypto. And I think at some point you'll see some of the DAPs get included in indexes. So that same pool of capital will start to flow into crypto. It's been friendly on the regulatory side, at least largely. You know, the US is passing some of the laws, the laws May not be perfect, but they're better than before. And also just the behavior of the regulatory agencies is far less aggressive, you know, far less, you know, arbitrary and capricious, if you will. And yet the prices are not up. So to me, this is okay. It might be a sign of maturity, but this is the story.

I guess there's a lot more leverage in the system with hyper liquid and, and all these. But sort of a perfect storm of circumstances and it just happened so fast and I guess, I guess all financial markets are like this. Like things can just explode, you know, in an instant. Or all financial markets with the enough liquidity and derivatives. Right. But that was wild. I'm gonna add a related but you know, you know, on the edge. So metals are at an all time high right now. Yes, we like when we were starting to build out metals we you know, acquired some for direct sale on our like version one marketplace. And like, like our average silver cost basis was like 25 bucks. 27, 29. It's like over 70. So like at least in the last day. I don't know what it's at right now. Gold also on all time high and crypto's down and it sort of shows. I've believed Sort of this for a while, but. And I hope it maybe becomes not true in the future. Mostly crypto does not behave like a defensive asset. It behaves like a high beta tech stock. It's risk on, you know, so you'll see if you know, the, the major tech companies go down, Bitcoin goes down and, and vice versa. Vice versa. It's not always true. I think Liberation Day, we saw that happen for both and then crypto actually went up in sort of a. Well, you know, if they're going to restrict the movement of goods and they're not going to restrict the movement of crypto, it's hard to do. Why is it, why is this? I think it's just like it's the same type of people buying both and they see it as a future facing technology speculative asset.

Gold also on all time high and cryptos down. And it sort of shows, I believe, sort of this for a while. But and I hope it maybe becomes not true in the future. Mostly crypto does not behave like a defensive asset. It behaves like a high beta tech stock. It's risk on, you know, so you'll see if The major tech companies go down, Bitcoin goes down and vice versa. It's not always true. I think Liberation Day, we saw that happen for both. And then crypto actually went up in sort of a, well, if they're going to restrict the movement of goods, they're not going to restrict the movement of crypto. It's hard to do. Why is it? Why is this? I think it's just like it's the same type of people buying both and they see it as a future facing technology speculative asset. I mean, for a long time, people have pointed out that if you look at crypto instead of acting as a hedge against the stock market it acts as more of a high alpha line of the stock market which either rather um the um early on Bitcoin was totally uncorrelated with the stock market but I think I think probably started being correlated at least by 2020 but maybe even like 2018 let's say okay Jim what was your biggest surprise of the year

When we were starting to build out metals, we acquired some for direct sale on our version one marketplace. And like, I feel like our average silver cost basis was like 25 bucks, 27, 29. It's like over 70. So at least in the last day, I don't know what that's right now. Gold also on all time high and crypto's down. And it sort of shows, I believe, sort of this for a while.

> Okay, so I'll quibble with Jim a little bit. I think, I guess mine's a little bit a meta story. So it depends what you mean by big. Like I have a little bit of a philosophical objection to news. News is always point in time and it doesn't really tell you trend. I think we would agree on this. And people that over-index on the current and then under-index on like what's really going on. And the biggest one for me was that adoption and in price have continued to decouple. We started to see maybe 2023, 2024, that the supply of stables on chain, it previously was correlated with crypto prices and it started to stop being correlated with crypto prices. And stables on chain are all time high and transaction volumes and stables doubled again between 2024 and 2025. I believe, I asked the AIs this, they all said that. So at the same time, prices are a little bit down from beginning of the year to end of the year. So this may just be how it is for a while. There's also other metrics like active wallets are up by maybe 10 million, depending on the time interval that you consider. There are different estimates. Mobile's up 20-ish percent. um and also the the institutions are clearly doing more than waiting in they're actually like quietly moving money with stables especially around the world um and there's more of a kind of recurring institutional buy that's going on where crypto part of the reason it's been so volatile is that you know a bunch of very aggressive speculators are buying and selling rapidly and if you compare stocks the stocks that get included in the major indexes you know quite often people have their send 500 bucks a month to vanguard right and so that smooths out the volatility to some degree in let's say high you know medium to high market cap stocks right that's actually a little bit starting to happen in crypto and i think at some point you'll see some of the debts get included in indexes so that same pool of capital will start to flow into crypto um It's been friendly on the regulatory side, at least largely. The U.S. is passing some of the laws. The laws may not be perfect, but they're better than before. And also just the behavior of the regulatory agencies is far less aggressive, far less arbitrary and capricious, if you will. And yet the prices are not up. So to me, this is OK. It might be a sign of maturity, but this is the story.
