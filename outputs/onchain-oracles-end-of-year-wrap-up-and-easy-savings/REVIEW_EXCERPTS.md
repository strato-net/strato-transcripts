> That's actually a little bit starting to happen in crypto. And I think at some point you'll see some of the DAPs get included in indexes. So that same pool of capital will start to flow into crypto. It's been friendly on the regulatory side, at least largely. You know, the US is Passing some of the laws. The laws may not be perfect, but they're better than before. And also just the behavior of the regulatory agencies is far less aggressive, you know, far less, you know, arbitrary and capricious, if you will. And yet the prices are not up. So to me, this is okay. It might be a sign of maturity, but this is the story.

> And then just like everything blew up. Like you know, you're up the next one. It's like whoa, like, like, like 20 billion. It was like the 20x larger liquidation than it ever happened before. I guess there's a lot more leverage in the system with hyper liquid and, and all these. But sort of a perfect storm of circumstances and it just happened so fast and I guess, I guess all financial markets are like this, like things can just explode, you know, in an instant or all financial markets with the enough liquidity and derivatives. Right. But that was wild. I'm gonna add a related but you know, you know, on the edge. So metals are at an all time high right now. Yes, we like when we were starting to build out metals, we you know, acquired some for direct sale on our like version one marketplace. And like, like our average silver cost basis was like 25 bucks. 27, 29. It's like over 70. So like at least in the last day. I don't know what it's at right now. Gold also on all time high and crypto's down and it sort of shows. I've believed sort of this for a while, but, and I hope it maybe becomes not true in the future. Mostly crypto does not behave like a defensive asset. It behaves like a high beta tech stock. It's risk on, you know, so you'll see if you know, the, the major tech companies go down, bitcoin goes down and, and vice versa, vice versa. It's not always true. I think Liberation day, we saw that happen for both and then crypto actually went up in sort of a. Well, you know, if they're going to restrict the movement of goods and they're not going to restrict the movement of crypto, it's hard to do. Why is it, why is this? I think it's just like it's the same type of people buying both and they see it as a future facing technology speculative asset.

**Intermediate:**

> Okay, so I thought about this. I have a two-part answer, slightly related. One, October 10th, that was like a Friday. I think we had wrapped some work up. I was sort of like, I can't remember exactly what was going on. But then, you know, it just, everything just, what's November 10th? 10-10, right? Yeah. And then just like everything blew up. Like, you know, you're up the next morning. It's like, whoa! Like... like 20 billion. It was like the 20x larger liquidation than had ever happened before. I guess there's a lot more leverage in the system with hyperliquid and all of these. But sort of a perfect storm of circumstances. And it just happened so fast. And I guess all financial markets are like this, like things can just explode or you know in an instant or all financial markets with the enough liquidity and derivatives right but um that was wild um i'm gonna add a related but you know you know on the edge so metals are at an all-time high right now yes we like when we were starting to build out metals we you know acquired some for direct sale on our like version one Marketplace and like I feel like our average silver cost basis was like 25 bucks 27 29 it's like over 70. So like at least in the last day, I don't know what's that right now. Gold also on all time high and cryptos down. And it sort of shows I believe sort of this for a while. But and I hope it maybe becomes not true in the future. Mostly crypto does not behave like a defensive asset. It behaves like a high beta tech stock. It's risk on, you know, so you'll see if The major tech companies go down, Bitcoin goes down, and vice versa. It's not always true. I think Liberation Day, we saw that happen for both. And then crypto actually went up in sort of a, well, if they're going to restrict the movement of goods, they're not going to restrict the movement of crypto. It's hard to do. Why is it? Why is this? I think it's just like it's the same type of people buying both and they see it as a future facing technology speculative asset. I mean, for a long time, people have pointed out that if you look at crypto instead of acting as a hedge against the stock market, it acts as more of a high alpha line of the stock market. Early on, Bitcoin was totally uncorrelated with the stock market, but I think it probably started being correlated at least by 2020, but maybe even like 2018, let's say.

I was sort of like, I can't remember exactly what was going on. But then, you know, it just, everything just, what's November 10th? 10-10, right? Yeah. And then just like everything blew up. Like, you know, you're up the next morning. It's like, whoa! Like 20 billion. It was like the 20x larger liquidation than had ever happened before. I guess there's a lot more leverage in the system with Hyperliquid and all of these. But sort of a perfect storm of circumstances. And it just happened so fast. And I guess all financial markets are like this, like things can just explode or, you know, in an instant, or all financial markets with enough liquidity and derivatives, right? But that was wild. I'm gonna add a related but, you know, on the edge. So metals are at an all-time high right now. Yes. When we were starting to build out metals we, you know, acquired some for direct sale on our like version one marketplace. And like I feel like our average silver cost basis was like 25 bucks, 27, 29. It's like over 70. So like at least in the last day, I don't know what that's right now. Gold also at all time high and crypto's down. And it sort of shows, I believe sort of this for a while, but and I hope it maybe becomes not true in the future. Mostly crypto does not behave like a defensive asset. It behaves like a high beta tech stock. It's risk on, you know, so you'll see if the major tech companies go down, Bitcoin goes down, and vice versa. It's not always true. I think Liberation Day, we saw that happen for both. And then crypto actually went up in sort of a, well, if they're going to restrict the movement of goods, they're not going to restrict the movement of crypto. It's hard to do.

I think it's just like it's the same type of people buying both and they see it as a future facing technology speculative asset. I mean, for a long time, people have pointed out that if you look at crypto instead of acting as a hedge against the stock market, it acts as more of a high alpha line of the stock market. Early on, Bitcoin was totally uncorrelated with the stock market, but I think it probably started being correlated at least by 2020, but maybe even like 2018, let's say.

> Okay, so I'll quibble with Jim a little bit. I think, I guess mine's a little bit a meta story. So it depends what you mean by big. Like I have a little bit of a philosophical objection to news. News is always point in time and it doesn't really tell you trend. I think we would agree on this. And people that over-index on the current and then under-index on like what's really going on. And the biggest one for me was that adoption and in price have continued to decouple. We started to see maybe 2023, 2024, that the supply of stables on chain, it previously was correlated with crypto prices and then started to stop being correlated with crypto prices. And stables on chain are all time high and transaction volumes and stables doubled again between 2024 and 2025. I believe, I asked the AIs this, they all said that. so at the same time prices are a little bit down from beginning of the year to end of the year so this may just be how it is for a while uh there's also other metrics like active wallets are up by maybe 10 million depending on the time interval that you consider uh there are different estimates mobile's up 20-ish percent um and also the the institutions are clearly doing more than waiting in they're actually like quietly moving money with stables especially around the world um and there's more of a kind of recurring institutional buy that's going on where crypto part of the reason it's been so volatile is that you know a bunch of very aggressive speculators are buying and selling rapidly And if you compare stocks, the stocks that get included in the major indexes, you know, quite often people have their send 500 bucks a month to Vanguard. Right. And so that smooths out the volatility to some degree in, let's say, high, you know, medium to high market cap stocks. Right. That's actually a little bit starting to happen in crypto. I think at some point you'll see some of the debts get included in indexes. So that same pool of capital will start to flow into crypto. It's been friendly on the regulatory side, at least largely. The U.S. is passing some of the laws. The laws may not be perfect, but they're better than before. And also just the behavior of the regulatory agencies is far less aggressive, far less arbitrary and capricious, if you will. And yet the prices are not up. So to me, this is OK. It might be a sign of maturity, but this is the story.

And also the institutions are clearly doing more than wading in. They're actually quietly moving money with stables especially around the world. And there's more of a kind of recurring institutional buy that's going on. Part of the reason crypto's been so volatile is that a bunch of very aggressive speculators are buying and selling rapidly.
