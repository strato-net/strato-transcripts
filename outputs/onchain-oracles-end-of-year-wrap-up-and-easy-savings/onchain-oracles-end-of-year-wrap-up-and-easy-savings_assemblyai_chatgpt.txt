SPEAKER_00: Okay, we are live. Welcome to this week’s On-Chain Oracles. As usual, I am joined—I'm Victor Wong, I’m Founder and Chief Product Officer at Strato. And as usual, I am joined with Kieran James Lubin, CEO of Strato, and the man with the oranges, Jim Hermes Di Iorio, CTO of Strato from sunny California.

SPEAKER_01: That’s not so sunny right now.

SPEAKER_00: Have you eaten many oranges, or are they just—

SPEAKER_01: There’s a tree behind me.

SPEAKER_00: Oh nice. Well, this week we are going to do our crypto year-in-review recap. But before we get into that, two quick things. One is at some point during the show I will announce a special giveaway, and it’s going to be a really special year-end giveaway. But in preparation, we recommend that everyone get a Strato account if you don’t have one already, and join our Telegram, because those will be two parts of it. And before we get into the URL—

SPEAKER_02: For the—to sign up.

SPEAKER_00: Yes, thank you. It is Strato, S T R A T O, Nexus to sign up.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And you can go straight to app.stratonexus.

SPEAKER_00: Yes, thanks, Kieran. And then we are joined by Michael Tan today for our Strato Spotlight, because we have lots of new features to show. Michael, what do you have for us today to talk—

SPEAKER_03: Hi everyone. I’m showing you guys the Easy Savings package path today. Basically, it’s bridging in stables from Ethereum and saving them, earning yield in the lending pool. So I start by connecting my Ethereum wallet. As such, it’s a really simple process as long as you have it in the browser. My wallet is connected. I can pick between USDC and USDT. We’re going to be adding a couple of different stables soon, including yield-bearing ones. Bridge in 100 here. Make sure this is checked so that it goes directly into the lending pool. We just added these cool modals, but you just need to confirm everything. Sign the permit, confirm the transaction. Why is it— All right, there you go. Takes a couple of seconds, waiting for the—all set. Great. Now—now should be receiving the deposit, one to two minutes into the lending pool. And that is your Easy Savings: fastest and easiest way to earn money, earn points on Strato.

SPEAKER_00: And now, so in the background, what’s happening, Michael? It looks like we’re converting from USDC into our local stable, USDST, and then putting it into the lending pool. Is that right?

SPEAKER_03: Yep, that’s correct. And you could do the same with USDT if you’d like.

SPEAKER_00: Awesome.

SPEAKER_03: And we also have a bridge-out feature if you ever need that over here. But for now, this is the easiest way to get money in the lending pool and start earning.

SPEAKER_00: Cool. And as everyone knows, we launched our Season One reward program roughly two weeks ago. So how’s that going, Michael?

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so we have quite a bit of points that have been issued. You can kind of check it here, the leaderboard, if you go to this tab. You can also go here to go directly to the leaderboard from the sidebar. But as it currently stands, looks like I’m number 13 on this. You can check out the different activities within the network that are being done to earn points as well. The rewards here—these are your different positions that are currently earning points. And this is my lending pool from Easy Savings.

SPEAKER_00: Awesome. Well, you’ve got to bump up your activity to get up on the chart. Yeah, get to the top three soon. Well, thank you for joining us, Michael, and we look forward to the next segment. So with that—great being here, take care.

SPEAKER_02: Thanks, Michael.

SPEAKER_00: Okay, so let’s talk about the crypto year in review. This has been, like—when I kind of reflected, I realized this kind of been a crazy year for crypto in general. And I think for us specifically, there’s just been so much going on. So let’s start with what you think is the biggest story of the year. And I’m going to start with Jim. Jim, from your boat—

SPEAKER_01: You know, I want to push back a little bit on this one because—I’m not going to push back, I’m going to answer the question. But I found this the least interesting of the questions because, sort of by definition, the biggest story is the stuff that we’ve all been talking about nonstop all year anyway. It’s the stuff that’s been in the news. So my answers to this are just going to be boring and obvious. In crypto in general—well, sorry, it’s—at Strato the big story was that this was a development year. We spent the whole year—we figured out what we wanted to do early on, we spent the whole year really making a great product and really only released it in the last few months. So that is the big story from us. In crypto in general, the big story was just the crazy ride that crypto took. It was like, you know, Bitcoin was down and then it was up and then it was down again. And I don’t even know where it is today, somewhere in the middle. And then in the middle of the year, I have this memory of seeing Eric Trump in Toronto introducing some crypto projects. So it’s just sort of a crazy ride this year in crypto. So—but I will pass it on.

SPEAKER_00: Okay. Kieran, what was your biggest story of the year?

SPEAKER_02: Okay, so I’ll quibble with Jim a little bit, I think. I guess mine’s a little bit a meta story. So it depends what you mean by big. Like I have a little bit of a philosophical objection to news. News is always point in time and it doesn’t really tell you trend. I think we would agree on this. And people that over-index on the current and then under-index on what’s really going on. And the biggest one for me was that adoption and price have continued to decouple. Like we started to see maybe 2023, 2024, that the supply of stables on-chain—it previously was correlated with crypto prices, and it started to stop being correlated with crypto prices. And stables on-chain are at all-time high, and transaction volumes in stables doubled again between 2024 and 2025, I believe. I asked the AIs this—they all said that. So at the same time, prices are a little bit down from beginning of the year to end of the year. So this may just be how it is for a while. There’s also other metrics like active wallets are up by maybe 10 million depending on the time interval that you consider. There are different estimates. Mobile’s up 20-ish percent. And also the institutions are clearly doing more than wading in. They’re actually quietly moving money with stables, especially around the world. And there’s more of a kind of recurring institutional buy that’s going on, where crypto—part of the reason it’s been so volatile is that a bunch of very aggressive speculators are buying and selling rapidly. And if you compare stocks, the stocks that get included in the major indexes, quite often people have their “send 500 bucks a month to Vanguard,” and so that smooths out the volatility to some degree, in, let’s say, medium to high market cap stocks. That’s actually a little bit starting to happen in crypto. And I think at some point you’ll see some of the dapps get included in indexes. So that same pool of capital will start to flow into crypto. It’s been friendly on the regulatory side, at least largely. The US is passing some of the laws. The laws may not be perfect, but they’re better than before. And also just the behavior of the regulatory agencies is far less aggressive, far less arbitrary and capricious, if you will. And yet the prices are not up. So to me, this is okay. It might be a sign of maturity, but this is the story.

SPEAKER_00: Well, I do think part of it might be that the adoption from institutions and more mainstream things is sort of a lagging—like a leading indicator of where it goes. It’s not like some big BlackRock announces some big thing and they turn it on immediately.

SPEAKER_02: So maybe—like it does feel like to me that most of the times the institutions are early and retail price action comes later. You see that like funding private companies: you need retail slash the public markets to get that next liquidity, right? I’m not sure because there was a time when everyone had their stimulus checks and was gambling at home during the pandemic, when—

SPEAKER_00: Like retail—everything, not just crypto.

SPEAKER_02: GameStop era. So I don’t know what the trend is now. I guess that was all stuff that was funded 2017, 2018 by ICOs, which were a mix of institutional and crypto whale retail and so on. So I don’t know. I think the retail comes back, but it’s a different form than the last time. Definitely, most people that trade in general—this includes stock day trading—something like 90% lose. One of our employees is fond of saying 90% lose, and on average it takes 18 to 24 months for them to admit it and stop, and just HODL, or, in effect. So we may have burned a whole lot of people, but different ones will come in the future, I think.

SPEAKER_00: So for me, I think the biggest story—well, maybe I’ll start with the crypto one and then just a general theme. The crypto one is the return of building that matters in the crypto space. And what I mean by that is I think in the previous year, it was sort of the rise of meme coins, right? Like people were just kind of—marketing was winning the day. And it really was the people who kind of could make a big splash or excitement in the market. And I was kind of shocked when I looked at the timeline that Libra was in February of this year. It feels so long ago. But now you see the projects that are rising, like the rise of Zcash—projects that have been building for a long time and really investing on the infrastructure side—and even the institutions getting involved on the infrastructure side, like “Temple by Stripe,” or things like Robinhood doing their own too. So I think as builders ourselves, I like to trend back toward building, and I think that’s a big trend this year. But I think part of the other trend, which is in crypto directly related, is that AI has gotten really, really good. And it kind of affects everything, but it certainly affects my day-to-day and I think our day-to-day ability to deliver, right? So our mutual friend Stephen Chu, who just published I think the first theoretical physics paper that was co-authored by an AI—he describes AI at this point as like a super genius that is kind of crazy, which is kind of exactly the thing. Yes, it does lead you on some odd goose chases sometimes. Hallucination isn’t over, but its potential to shortcut so many things is so powerful. Well, you guys, I think we’re going—

SPEAKER_01: Through a phase right now in the last couple of months where people are sort of figuring out the limits of AI, which is a step in this, because now that’s going to bring us to the next stage. Like early in the year it just looked like it was magic and can do everything. And now—but we knew it wasn’t doing everything because it hasn’t taken over the world yet. But now we’re sort of understanding what it is that it can do and can’t do.

SPEAKER_00: And even how to check kind of what it should be doing, right? Like I think when we just took the outputs and assumed, okay, those are okay. But I think it’s like checking it. What do you think, Kieran?

SPEAKER_02: Let me add an example. I’ve talked a bunch of times about getting back into writing code because the AI is so good, and I thought that this applied mostly to the app layer of our stack. For those who haven’t seen it, we have an app that lets you save in high-quality assets, participate in swap pools, lending pools, all that sort of thing. It looks like somewhere between a DeFi app—and it’s definitely DeFi in architecture—and a Coinbase-style app. And so the AI is actually really good at writing code in the app layer. But I didn’t think so. We also have our own in-house blockchain that we worked on for years, starting with being an Ethereum mainnet client, kind of forking off for enterprise use, and then going back to being our own standalone L1. I didn’t think the AI was going to be ready to help code in the really hardcore platform layer. But at least for simpler stuff, I discovered a couple of weeks ago that it can, in fact—that if I describe the thing, you have to have a good instinct for how the pieces work together. Like the peer-to-peer process is doing this, and we see this in the logs, and then the data is getting to the VM this way. I still have all of that, but I can barely write the Haskell anymore. But I don’t have to if I keep it pretty constrained. And this is like a surgical fix, not like a big rewrite I couldn’t do or something like that. I could just describe what’s wrong and what’s probably right, and it more or less gets it right. And I don’t think it could do the Haskell six months ago. It’s pretty good now—again, for surgical fixes. It’s not like really big stuff, but it’s—you know, each part of our stack getting more accessible to AI is a remarkable change. I’d also say: I remember when I was very good at net-new code snippets but couldn’t read a codebase, and now it can read a codebase. Like maybe as of a year ago, maybe eight months, ten months, it can read a codebase so much faster than I can that I just don’t need to read the codebase, except line-by-line on a specific issue. Sorry, go ahead.

SPEAKER_01: So Stephen did say something in the podcast that until he said it, I was intuiting it, but it really was an aha moment when he said it. I’ve been wondering why—even though I have all these amazing tools—why sometimes I am not going a lot faster than I’m going, and in fact sometimes I’m even slowed down. And he expressed something that he had experienced in writing the physics paper, which is the wild goose chase problem. These things know too much and they can throw out lots of great ideas, and you can go off and just spend hours trying to research the ideas, and you end up wasting more time researching all the potential good ideas, and a lot of them don’t pan out. Some of them do. Sometimes I learn—there’s enough of a yield to it where I get some lifetime tool out of it, that it was worth it to do it. But I’m wasting a lot of time just slavishly doing what the AI wants me to do. And I’ve gotten a little bit ruder with the AI lately and telling it, “That’s a stupid idea. I’m not going to waste my—”

SPEAKER_02: But yeah, that also—it sometimes feels like there’s certain types of attorneys or accountants or whatever, professional service workers who want the belt-and-suspenders thing. Like, “Let me give the answer that minimizes my risk as the professional services provider,” and by the way, maybe cost the client a lot of time and money. I agree. You have to yell at it when it gets a little too—I don’t know.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And the thing is also—I think—well, I think the thing with Steve that he also said—by the way, everyone should check out the latest episode on the Manifold podcast because he did the paper with the AI on physics, which I don’t understand, Jim, you’re going to have to explain to me one day.

SPEAKER_03: But—

SPEAKER_00: But he also did another paper on how he did use the AI to write the paper, and that I found fascinating. I feel like we’re entering what I call the centaur phase. There was this phase in chess with AI where the best chess players were actually computer chess engines combined with expert chess players, right? And I feel like that’s where we are now. You need some level—you need to be an expert yourself to be able to evaluate the output of what the AI does. And you can’t always just say, “Oh, the AI should know what it is.”

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but it’s like the AI telling the master chess player to go off and play 20 games to try different things out or something.

SPEAKER_02: The solution is ask the other AI.

SPEAKER_00: Double-check that thing though.

SPEAKER_01: You don’t even have to ask another AI. These things are myopic enough that if you just turn around and ask the same AI, sometimes it’s very angry at its own first—what irritates me a lot is when it’s like, “Here is a snippet of code for you to try out.” And I try it and it doesn’t work, and I come back to it, and the AI is like, “You’re an idiot for trying that snippet of code. Obviously it wouldn’t work.”

SPEAKER_00: One area AIs have not gotten down though is spatial reasoning. I did ask it to come up with a design for a box and give me the lumber that I needed. I just kind of grabbed the list, ran off, got it, and then I came back and it was totally wrong. And then when I looked at the diagram, it was like the wood had overlapped with each other in space. Spatial reasoning seems—it seems like—

SPEAKER_02: You would need to train it on a bunch of engineering diagrams or something. That’s actually—someone should do that. I’m surprised. Probably a bunch of people are working on it.

SPEAKER_00: I’m sure they’re working on it. And I think this is sort of in the space between the diffusion models and the LLMs. So I think that’s where a bunch of people are working on getting those. But I think when you ask the spatial relationship questions, you can be sent to one or the other and it sometimes gets confused. Okay, second big category: biggest surprise of the year. I’m going to start with Kieran. What’s that?

SPEAKER_02: Okay, so I thought about this. I have a two-part answer, slightly related. October 10th—that was like—it was like a Friday. I think we had wrapped some work up. I can’t remember exactly what was going on. But then it just—everything just—was it November 10? 10/10, right.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: And then just like everything blew up. You’re up the next one, it’s like, whoa. Like 20 billion. It was like the 20x larger liquidation than it ever happened before. I guess there’s a lot more leverage in the system with Hyperliquid and all these. But sort of a perfect storm of circumstances, and it just happened so fast. And I guess all financial markets are like this—things can just explode in an instant, or all financial markets with enough liquidity and derivatives, right? But that was wild. I’m going to add a related but on-the-edge one: metals are at an all-time high right now. Yes, like when we were starting to build out metals, we acquired some for direct sale on our version-one marketplace. And our average silver cost basis was like 25 bucks, 27, 29. It’s like over 70—at least in the last day. I don’t know what it’s at right now. Gold also at all-time high, and crypto’s down, and it sort of shows—I’ve believed sort of this for a while, and I hope it maybe becomes not true in the future—mostly crypto does not behave like a defensive asset. It behaves like a high-beta tech stock. It’s risk-on, so you’ll see if the major tech companies go down, Bitcoin goes down, and vice versa, vice versa. It’s not always true. I think Liberation Day, we saw that happen for both, and then crypto actually went up in sort of a—well, if they’re going to restrict the movement of goods and they’re not going to restrict the movement of crypto, it’s hard to do. Why is it? I think it’s just like it’s the same type of people buying both and they see it as a future-facing technology speculative asset.

SPEAKER_00: I mean, for a long time people have pointed out that if you look at crypto, instead of acting as a hedge against the stock market, it acts as more of a high-alpha line of the stock market.

SPEAKER_02: Early on, Bitcoin was totally uncorrelated with the stock market. But I think it probably started being correlated at least by 2020, but maybe even like 2018, let’s say.

SPEAKER_00: Okay. Jim, what was your biggest surprise of the year?

SPEAKER_01: So I’m going to say the return of—even though it never went away—and by the way, this might be recency bias because this has all been the last couple of months in my world—but the return of ZK into the world. Suddenly about two months ago I started hearing everybody talk about it again. When we were down in Argentina, a lot of the talks were about that. People were all asking us, “What’s your ZK strategy?” You guys all of a sudden got really interested in the Zcash client that I had worked a bit on a couple years ago. It looks like it’s probably real right now because there are certain applications that are actually working, although I won’t say which. But I went to a bunch of talks in Argentina that clearly were vaporware—maybe that’s even generous—like things that didn’t make sense to me. But there are a couple of applications, and the scaling application that I guess will probably happen in Ethereum could be big.

SPEAKER_00: It’s kind of exciting. Yeah. I mean, if you look at the trend lines, it’s crazy. I think last year to do a proof on the Ethereum blockchain testnet, it took a computer with like 48 GPUs, and then now it’s down to four. So it’s really accelerating. I’m not sure why that’s happening, but it does seem to be positive.

SPEAKER_02: I think many things are true at once on the “why.” This is speculation, but one: the EU came out and said, “Oh, you’re going to need a driver’s license to use the internet.” And this scared the crap out of everybody. And we were like, we weren’t taking the privacy thing—we just wanted to pump these prices. But are they going to—am I going to need to put my fingerprint for my computer to turn on? No one has suggested that yet, but—so the cypherpunk fundamentals kind of have come back into the focus as, at least visibly, governments seem to want to reassert or assert control over the internet. And yeah, I think the privacy people were here in the background. We went to the Cypherpunk Congress at the beginning of Devconnect, and clearly these people had just been there for 10 years. We kind of forgot about them and they’re just still there. But as a meta—you know, like the Zcash price went crazy. I think definitely some people were trying to find a way to rotate out of something into something else without making it look like they’re selling the thing. But it’s also—I think maybe also post–meme coins, there was sort of a value rediscovery going on, in that even the kind of more extract-y crypto types seem to have some cypherpunk inclination. Not always. There’s a lot of new entrants that are more like the Wall Street personality. But I think some mix of organic and manufactured—then the price action got everyone thinking about it again. One thing that occurred to me as I started researching privacy again—because we spent lots of time with it both in our enterprise days and then subsequently we were kind of trying to figure it out before mainnet launch, which is why Jim built most of the Zcash client and then we kind of dropped it for a while—part of the reason it came back for me is that it also seems more viable. Like there’s a bunch of competing Ethereum ecosystem privacy products like Railgun, Privacy Pools, and so on. I guess Roman Storm was in the news a bunch during the year—Roman Storm of Tornado Cash, of course. And I didn’t realize that it kind of maybe basically works, and it sort of didn’t. Like Zcash also had added—they’ve got a mobile wallet now that supposedly just works, and it’s easy to shield. It wasn’t easy to shield before. So some perfect storm of factors seem to reignite the privacy thing.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: And it’s easy to shield. It wasn’t easy to shield before. So some perfect storm of factors seem to reignite the privacy thing.

SPEAKER_00: Well, I think part of it is just people realize—as maybe a new kind of mainstream adoption is taking place—people are realizing, “Oh crap, my balances are in fact public.”

SPEAKER_02: Yeah, there’s a wrench attack per year per week in 2025, something like that.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So I think too there was an assumption that my balances are—worse yet, I think for mainstream audiences—and now they’re not. So my biggest surprise of the year was really the Robinhood announcement. And it wasn’t that Robinhood was doing stuff in crypto—we knew that forever. But the kind of many things they announced at the same time: their own L2 that they’re putting, that they had their own tokenization engine, that they were doing secondary stocks and kind of pushing it out immediately. I think it got everyone really interested and excited. I think that sort of put in the arms race of institutional adoption. I think that kick-started it and it was surprising because we have worked with a bunch of big enterprises and governments in our history at Strato, and even when they do some giant press release, it all moves at some glacial pace. So I think we’re going to see some traction and making that more real, but it’s going to move a hell of a lot slower than everyone on crypto Twitter thinks. But I do think like I said, the first kind of “shoe to drop” in the world of ZK is going to be around ZK scaling, and I think we’re going to see huge improvements on this year. So Kieran, what are your predictions? Bring us home.

SPEAKER_02: Okay, so I predict—and it’s not unrelated to Jim’s—a continued DeFi/TradFi soft merger where you’ll see TradFi capabilities in DeFi, you’ll see TradFi using DeFi rails from stables and into more sophisticated stuff. Something remarkable: in some ways, Aave is like the federal funds rate of—you know, like the USDC borrow rate on Aave is kind of the benchmark for sort of low-risk borrowing in crypto. And that’s remarkable. Like everything else in the world just instantly reacts to what the Fed does—and maybe crypto does too. The prices certainly do. But the stable borrowing markets, maybe it’s a little bit indirect. And so I think we should see some level of continued boringness. And that boringness is probably a good sign even though we want good excitingness at different times. So in that category: stables keep going up in supply and volume. RWAs continue to get bigger. We saw a big run starting the year in—let’s see—like PAXG and others. Obviously our RWAs are way up in circulation as this year goes on. And part of the reason is just like—even dollars don’t solve inflation in total. It’s much better if your option is—or at least until recently, probably still the Argentinian peso—to hold USDC, let’s say. But this year gold, silver would have been better, or Treasuries are better than just dollars, for instance, I think. Well, for practical reasons you need—the world is priced in fiat, at least for now, and may continue to be. So you just need a mix of things. Go along with your crypto but also hold some other stuff so that day to day you’re not in trouble. I also think related to Jim’s point, the way I wrote in my little notes here is that value capture will keep moving up the stack. There was a time where what you did was write a 60-page technical white paper, maybe you were a professor or something, raise like 50 to $250 million on-chain, build some complex blockchain. Sometimes they worked, sometimes they didn’t. And there was like an L1 premium and even an L2 premium: having control of the infrastructure makes the token go higher. I think there’s still a little bit of that. And we ourselves are an alt L1. And in part it’s just like you inherit a lot of assets primarily bridged in from Ethereum. That’s like the only real big source. And we have small integrations with Base and all that sort of thing. But I think the reason really we did it is to be able to deliver a better app on the top end. And so you’ll see most of the value capture will start to be just fighting over users as opposed to more abstract infrastructure promises—throughput, cheaper transactions, and so on. I think the market is mostly moving away from that. There are still some, but it’s again like the Lighters, the Hyperliquids, Linea recently are fairly high in the stack. Like there’s a big anchor app at a minimum for all of them: Perp DEX, the wallet, various other apps on Linea. And it’s a short list of successful L1s and L2s. Polymarket is on Polygon. I think that’s a coincidence, but it’s kind of funny. And that’s the thing that really keeps the alt chains going. Of course you try to get implementations of all the major protocols on there. But yeah—so I agree with Jim, it’s about the usability. But in a specific sense, we’ve got to actually just get people to live their lives in this thing.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah. The way I think of it is kind of adoption over research. I think when we started, all the big new chains were effectively like research projects. There were big ideas and things that may or may not be delivered. And now, really, it’s about—

SPEAKER_02: They kind of deliver the whole thing before the TGE now.

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, exactly. Well, with that, thank you very much for joining us for our year-in-review recap. I’m Victor Wong. You can find us at Strato Nexus, and we hope you have a happy holidays. And please sign up for our giveaway and enjoy some vitamin C and sunshine—at least Jim is. Take care.

SPEAKER_02: Thanks everybody. Happy holidays.
