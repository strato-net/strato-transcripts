# TODO: Add whisperx-server once a distributable package/URL is available

# PyTorch versions COMMENTED OUT - installed by shell script instead
# WhisperX 3.7.4 requires torch~=2.8.0, but we need 2.9.x for RTX 5070 Blackwell support
# This creates a dependency conflict that pip cannot resolve
# Solution: Install WhisperX with its torch 2.8.0, then upgrade to 2.9.1 in shell script
