EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Based on comprehensive testing across 54 processed transcript combinations from 3 ASR services and 4 LLM services, this report provides data-driven quality assessments derived from actual file analysis rather than theoretical expectations.

KEY FINDINGS:
- ASR quality directly determines compression efficiency and final output quality
- WhisperX Cloud enables dramatically better LLM post-processing than AssemblyAI/Deepgram
- Llama 3.1 8B Instant provides the optimal balance of efficiency and quality
- 90-minute episodes show 4-6x differences in input transcript sizes between ASR services
- Best pipeline (WhisperX + Llama) produces professional-quality transcripts at speed-quality optimum
