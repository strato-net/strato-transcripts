**[00:00] SPEAKER_00:** Hello, hello, hello, hello. Great to see you, my friend. So we are here. We are here in Prague, in beautiful Prague, Dark Prague. The inaugural Dark Prague 0 Congress conference. I'm not quite sure what you'd call it, but yeah, delighted to talk to you today, really within a context of this early days of Ethereum project that I've been looking at. And one of the things I remember seeing earliest was the two Amirs that you had. Capitalist Amir and anarchist Amir. So tell me, you know, before all that started even, you know, how did your.

**[00:53] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, how come you're doing this project?

**[00:55] SPEAKER_00:** How come I'm doing it?

**[00:56] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. What's the.

**[00:57] SPEAKER_00:** Well, it was quite. I mean, it's quite coincidental. You know, I'd. I'd gathered a bunch of information back in 2017, 2018, basically because Ming Chan was getting hoofed out and I asked Vitalik if what I could do to help, you know, anything with. Help with the transition or whatever, and he said, can you, can you like, go and talk to people in the community and sort of see what they think the Ethereum foundation should be like, what should we be doing?

**[01:35] SPEAKER_01:** Oh dear. If you ask that question, it's already bad sign.

**[01:39] SPEAKER_00:** Well, my question at that thought, at that point was, so Ming was terrible. She's one of the least professional people I've ever worked with. She was an absolute nightmare. And my thought was, well, what the hell was happening before that? That she looked like a good choice. And there was a real sort of shroud of mystery as to what had happened then, even though it was only like three or four years before. And so like there just was no canonical history. Nobody really knew what happened. Even something as basic as, like, was Charles like kind of a co founder or not? He kind of says he was maybe, but maybe he wasn't, which is just crazy because, you know, he was there like doing videos and like, there's just tons of evidence. But anyway, so I started digging back into Anthony Di Iorio. Yes, that's right. There were three.

**[02:36] SPEAKER_01:** Didn't he get rocked or something?

**[02:37] SPEAKER_00:** There were, there was, there was Anthony Di Orio.

**[02:40] SPEAKER_01:** I don't know the history.

**[02:41] SPEAKER_00:** There was Anthony d', Onofrio, that was Texture. And there was another guy called Anthony Eufemio who did this Digix Gold thing. But anyway, so that's where I started. Like getting interested in Ethereum history is just like, well, what the hell happened? I mean, what ended up happening is everything I recommended to Vitalik, like, never happened. Like, it was just completely disaster. You know, Ming went and he just got Aya. Here you go. It's a new one. No changes. Like the, the. The. What people wanted was like transparency. They wanted community input. They wanted like professional, executive, like operational. It's like, you know, let's have organization to help the devs, basically. But primarily it was like, don't be a Swiss opaque foundation with no accountability or any public information at all. Anyway, so I put the stuff aside at that point. It's like, great. That was a good use of my time, you know, advising the millionaire for free for months. But then just recently, so guys I now work with, they started recording some videos because. So Kieran is. Kieran James Lubin is Joe's son. So he was actually around from March 2014 and the others were sort of involved from 2015. And they were just like, we should like get some of these memories down, right? It was like eight years ago at that point. So they did a couple of those videos and I, you know, I really loved them and I was making tons of notes and finding links and photos and all of this, and then they interviewed me for the third one. But then more recently I did interviews with Taylor Gehring and with Texture and just tons of stuff came out of that. And then I just kind of like shoved those together and there you go. That's early days of Ethereum is this sort of combination of sort of biographical stuff and photos and videos, links to articles and then, you know, conversations with people. And it's really just because it's like, this is history, right? This stuff was crazy.

**[05:12] SPEAKER_01:** Seeing being in crypto since like, you know, almost the beginning, and seeing the stuff that happens, but seeing what got recorded, right? And it's like, wow, like history really is just written by the victors. Yeah, it's just crazy.

**[05:32] SPEAKER_00:** So the. This. The one thing on that score which I don't know if you know is. So the original bitcoin talk post for announcing Ethereum. So that was done on 23rd January 2014, right? Just before the bitcoin Miami. That page got changed about. About eight months later, probably around August, September. It got. It got quick edited and a whole load of people that were there got written out.

**[06:10] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, you mean like just somebody they.

**[06:13] SPEAKER_00:** Well, I mean, I guess you can edit bitcoin talk pages, but what about.

**[06:19] SPEAKER_01:** The people getting deleted and stuff?

**[06:21] SPEAKER_00:** So, yeah, just a whole bunch of people got deleted out.

**[06:24] SPEAKER_01:** By who? The admins?

**[06:26] SPEAKER_00:** Well, by Vitalik, I imagine.

**[06:28] SPEAKER_01:** But how do you edit people out of your thread?

**[06:31] SPEAKER_00:** No, no, the original post said, hey, we're Ethereum, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. This is the team. This is what we're doing.

**[06:39] SPEAKER_01:** I see.

**[06:40] SPEAKER_00:** I. So that post, which at the start went, look, here's about the 30 people that are working on things, went down to. Oh, right, Charles and Amir. Well, Amir I don't think was in the original post because he didn't want to be. But. But Charles got edited out, Stefan and Taylor Gehring got edited in, and all the rest of the team got shoved off the page. Yeah, but, you know, many, many people that were involved early, you know, they're just like forgotten. You know, they were on. You know, if you go back to early Internet Archive versions, you can find some names. So, I mean, some people, like Mr. Ryan Taylor over here. So Ryan worked on all the early websites for months. You know, these. These pages that thousands or tens of thousands of people have seen, as you know, this is the main Ethereum page. Nobody knew who did it. I didn't know. Like, you know, just on one of the early ones, just for a little while, it just said like, Ryan Taylor Webb. I know who Ryan Taylor is. Like, so a number of these names, you know, I don't know who they are or maybe start to find them. And basically, you know, it's. It's like the work of many hands, right? This is something I was talking about is, you know, you've got like, great man theory, right? The thought that you have these exceptional people and by amazing powers of, you know, intellectual skills and power of force, that they bend the universe to their will. And, you know, that's kind of the story that people like feudalism.

**[08:21] SPEAKER_01:** It's like, you pledge your allegiance to his liege.

**[08:25] SPEAKER_00:** That's right.

**[08:26] SPEAKER_01:** And if he. If your liege becomes popular, you all like, right? Gain through him, you will live vicariously.

**[08:35] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Or if you, you know, tech world operate. Yeah, well, you know, like, people are looking for heroes and, you know, they're champions to cheer, you know, in the. In the highest case, you know, something like North Korea. They literally think the leader is, you know, is a God. You know, they're just crying in front of him, just, oh, so amazing. So, yeah, I'm. I'm trying to record the real truth and give people their voices and. And just make sure stuff doesn't get lost. Right. So many things have already been lost.

**[09:08] SPEAKER_01:** Pete Rizzo did that for bitcoin, right? He's like. He did really, really deep history of bitcoin stuff.

**[09:16] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah. So check him out as well. Yeah, so. So, yeah, I'm finding stuff and you know, you shared your old YouTube channel with me as well. You seem to have a reasonable number of artifacts of various ages that have been preserved about you.

**[09:36] SPEAKER_01:** Funny, because I was just filming and I was just putting it. My video camera on the Internet on YouTube. So that's why I have that page.

**[09:46] SPEAKER_00:** Right. It's. It's funny. There's a, There's a guy called Freddie Hartline who was one of the guys that started the main. Kind of like it was like bitcoin co working space or whatever in Vancouver. But he was saying he's got loads of stuff on his Facebook account of all things basically. Even though it's like as boomer as you can imagine, it's like, yep, loads of other people have had things on so many other platforms and everything, they've all got lost and fucked. I've just posted shit on my Facebook page and it's, you know, it's, it's up there forever. Obviously like preserving things yourself is way better than relying on any of these platforms. But yeah, like so much stuff has just like rotted because people have deleted their accounts or like a platform isn't around anymore or just you know, general, general kind of rot.

**[10:46] SPEAKER_01:** But everything I have from this survived is because I uploaded it to like a, A normie platform.

**[10:53] SPEAKER_00:** Yes. Well, this is it.

**[10:55] SPEAKER_01:** I like periodically have like a, a cleanse, cleansing like a non. It's not accidental but it's just like every few years, you know, your data just reset to zero.

**[11:06] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, it sucks.

**[11:08] SPEAKER_01:** It, you know.

**[11:09] SPEAKER_00:** Well that's it. Yeah, I mean that. So yeah, that was Freddie's super normie story is still using Facebook even though, you know it's Facebook. So. Yeah, I mean, you know, you were, you were a free software guy and a general developer on that thread and early, early bitcoin devs. So like how did you find bitcoin?

**[11:42] SPEAKER_01:** So I was, yeah, I was working on free software for five, six years and then off and then I became a professional poker player.

**[11:54] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[11:55] SPEAKER_01:** That was for two. That was for over two years. And the poker sites, you know, you're playing against other players.

**[12:01] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[12:03] SPEAKER_01:** But the way the sites operate the platform, they take a cut out of every, every pot, basically every game that you play.

**[12:12] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[12:13] SPEAKER_01:** So. But the sites charge a huge amount of fees for like a really crappy service. So I had this idea, what if you could have a P2P site, then it wouldn't have rake and fees.

**[12:26] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[12:27] SPEAKER_01:** So I had like the design for it, but then the main issue was the payment system and so then I was on IRC in this channel with other anarcho hackers I know, and I was telling them about that. And this guy just is like a mathematician that worked for the W3C Melvin. He dumped just like 10 links in there. And you know, they're like random open source projects for like, money. And there's stuff like, let's. Have you heard of lets.

**[13:03] SPEAKER_00:** No, no.

**[13:04] SPEAKER_01:** That was at one point. People like, really into that. But it's like you. But off. I think it's like offering your labor. You get like a token or something. But anyway, so I would say going for one of all of these links and they're going, no, no, no, no. I saw Bitcoin. I opened the page for Bitcoin. He goes, bitcoin is a for is a P2P currency that cannot be controlled by governments or central banks. And then I was like, that's garbage. Like, obviously not. That's just because there's like loads of random projects like that on Source Forge. Back in the day, I once saw like a Jurassic park video game and it was going like you could do everything. You can punch through the walls, you can hack the terminals, you can hunt the dinosaurs. And I, like, I was like, whoa, sounds amazing. And I checked the code and it said like, main cpp. And they had like just, you know, one file. Like it just got. It got bored of it. It like it just wrote the idea.

**[14:07] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[14:08] SPEAKER_01:** And then like, I kept checking months every so often and there's like zero progress on that. So I thought Bitcoin was like one of those kind of projects. So I went, no, no, no. And then I was like, oh, they're all shit. So I was like, okay, let's take a deeper look at all of them then. And so then when it came to Bitcoin one, I downloaded the source code and I started going through the source code and I was like, oh, it's really interesting. First of all, Bitcoin source code is about 15,000 lines of code at that time.

**[14:36] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[14:36] SPEAKER_01:** Which, you know, 15,000 lines of code. It's actually a small amount of lines of code. Like some programmers can even do that in like a week or something. Like very talented programmers. But. So I was like, oh, but it's not nothing either. It's not like that Jurassic park game I was just describing. So it's like 20, you know, 15,000 lines of code. Like, let's.

**[14:58] SPEAKER_00:** You can. You can read through and kind of understand.

**[15:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So I printed it all out and I covered it all over my Floor.

**[15:03] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[15:04] SPEAKER_01:** You know, it's like my pornography that I'm looking at. I started studying it.

**[15:07] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[15:08] SPEAKER_01:** And it started to make sense. I was like, oh, very interesting. Oh, interesting. And so when I figured out how it worked, I was like, whoa, this is amazing. I'm gonna work on this, like. And so then.

**[15:19] SPEAKER_00:** So what month do you think that was?

**[15:21] SPEAKER_01:** That was the summer of 2010.

**[15:23] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[15:24] SPEAKER_01:** So that's when I like, basically I was like, okay, I'm just doing this amount. And so then I had like a. So I made like a plan of like, oh, in 10 years we'll be here, etc.

**[15:34] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Right.

**[15:36] SPEAKER_01:** Because I was like, this is like a long term thing I'm going to work on. But then that basically just happened really quickly. Like just started growing massively. So it was pretty crazy. But I started working on bitcoin, started writing code. You know, I was one of the first five bitcoin developers, which I was like listed on bitcoindog.

**[15:54] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[15:54] SPEAKER_01:** But that page is gone from the Internet. So people. It's like, they don't.

**[15:58] SPEAKER_00:** Maybe. Maybe it got archived.

**[16:00] SPEAKER_01:** No, I don't think so.

**[16:01] SPEAKER_00:** No, just gone.

**[16:02] SPEAKER_01:** Bitcoin web page with the list of names.

**[16:04] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[16:05] SPEAKER_01:** So like, I had a war with Gavin Andreessen.

**[16:07] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[16:08] SPEAKER_01:** Because he was like a. He's a. Like in many ways. But basically he really likes regulations and the state and stuff like that. He's a statist and he's like into the banks and stuff. But also he was just not that good a dev. And when there was like other young devs that were coming up, instead of trying to like nurture them, he was instead like trying to push them out and try and keep control. So I became like his main enemy, basically. I was like his first enemy. And then he kind of seemed like.

**[16:39] SPEAKER_00:** He never wanted the role even. He just sort of got.

**[16:42] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Kind of locked into it.

**[16:44] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[16:44] SPEAKER_01:** And then he was there and he's like, oh, I want to keep it. I really like it, you know. So, yeah, I like went to the very first event presenting bitcoin to. It was to audience of bankers. And so I did my talk and afterwards Gavin Andreessen, he DM me and he goes, I think you should not talk at conferences ever again. I was like, who the is this guy? You're not in charge of project you.

**[17:10] SPEAKER_00:** But was this in London or in the US Somewhere? Amsterdam. Right.

**[17:15] SPEAKER_01:** But anyway. So you know, one of the first things that Gav Andreessen did.

**[17:22] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[17:22] SPEAKER_01:** Was to try and get my name off of that list. Name added. But anyway, right. So he was like that. And.

**[17:32] SPEAKER_00:** You know, I mean, did you end up starting libitcoin quite early then?

**[17:39] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. 2011. Yeah, mid like March 2011 or something.

**[17:43] SPEAKER_00:** And was that around the same time as bips? Was that kind of like you were coordinating that? It's kind of like. Right. We need, we need specs, we need multiple clients.

**[17:53] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Because Gavin saw Bitcoin not as an open source project but as a startup.

**[18:01] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[18:01] SPEAKER_01:** So he's like, we need to like pull ranks and we need to like make these future features and changes so we can make a payment system that's.

**[18:09] SPEAKER_00:** Fast, make a road map.

**[18:12] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I don't know, it was more like just he wanted to operate it like a business.

**[18:16] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[18:17] SPEAKER_01:** And so I was like very worried because he was, because he wasn't treating it like an open source protocol. It was like we need to have this thing, we need to have that thing. So I was like, there need to be some constraint on his like wild ideas. So that's why I proposed that system. And thing is like Gavin, I mean I don't talk about people, but anyway, yeah. So I made that BIP system for that reason was. I was just afraid of that direction. That side of bitcoin.

**[18:52] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[18:52] SPEAKER_01:** Which they later made a foundation.

**[18:54] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[18:56] SPEAKER_01:** And they put themselves as chief scientist and they tried to do this. It was takeover of business guys on bitcoin.

**[19:04] SPEAKER_00:** And yeah.

**[19:05] SPEAKER_01:** They wanted, they were like, we have to push out the anarchists.

**[19:08] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[19:08] SPEAKER_01:** It was just like, it's like this attitude of like, oh, these crazy anarchists, they've invented this like new plaything and it's just so it's like really interesting toy and if we just pry out of their hands then we can get it accepted by big banks and then it can do something useful. Whereas our side.

**[19:26] SPEAKER_00:** You're putting people off.

**[19:27] SPEAKER_01:** Huh?

**[19:27] SPEAKER_00:** You're putting people off. All this anarchist talk. You know, we're trying to sell this thing.

**[19:33] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. I had. So our side was like more like, oh, this is like an actual new economic paradigm.

**[19:40] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[19:40] SPEAKER_01:** And you know, so it's interesting because now all the bitcoin maxis are very bitcoin maxi. But on for example, when I first met Peter Willer.

**[19:52] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[19:52] SPEAKER_01:** In or SIPA, one of the core devs of Bitcoin in 2011. And I was talking to him in the conference and he says, he says, oh, I'm not really interested in the monetary aspect of bitcoin.

**[20:06] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[20:07] SPEAKER_01:** I'm more interested just in the. No. The scripting language.

**[20:10] SPEAKER_00:** Okay, Right.

**[20:11] SPEAKER_01:** It Enables smart contracts and programmability. Yeah, he wasn't interested in the money thing.

**[20:17] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[20:17] SPEAKER_01:** So this new bitcoin fanatic ideology.

**[20:20] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[20:20] SPEAKER_01:** Is like retroactive. Back then people in bitcoin were like, oh, we want to explore.

**[20:25] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, like what you can do, you know. Well, I mean for the longest time there was this thought that, you know, all innovation that happens elsewhere will come back to bitcoin. Right. It's, it's inevitable. You know, we don't have to be like pushing anything ourselves because you know, like it'll just all, all come home.

**[20:44] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. The problem with bitcoin is the, it became taken over by these people that they like going to conferences, right. It's like, you know, they see people they know, you know, a lot of, you know, culty, massive bitcoin people, you know, they will want to like, like I love you, you're amazing. You know, like, and these people, they're not interested in the bigger mission or sense of. It's like it's about themselves. And so bitcoin got taken over by these like influencers essentially.

**[21:19] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[21:20] SPEAKER_01:** And the thing is when somebody come and says, you know, let's do something big, let's rock the boat. Yeah, they're going to see that as an enemy. Because that's why bitcoin is so conservative is because it's been, it's been taken over by this class of people.

**[21:36] SPEAKER_00:** There was like sailors, like absolutely the worst for this. There was a little video of him I saw the other day or yesterday which was saying the biggest risk to bitcoin is like competent and enthusiastic devs.

**[21:56] SPEAKER_01:** Well, I need to see the full.

**[21:58] SPEAKER_00:** Quote because that sounds ridiculous but he basically seems to have gone for this absolute full on ossification of saying, you know, these developers, they want to actually change things and that's a problem. We should never change anything. We need to be thinking in hundred year timelines because you know, this is the proof of, sorry, this is the, you know, the store of value that's going to save humanity. And that's. And that's all there is, right, that, that store of value narrative and don't use it, don't use your bitcoin.

**[22:43] SPEAKER_01:** Well the thing is there's this book in the 90s which is the sovereign individual.

**[22:48] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[22:49] SPEAKER_01:** I'm not saying I agree with all the book, but it does, it does make interesting analysis. It's definitely worth studying. And it says that Israel in 1997 and it's talking about cryptocurrency and it's saying how the invention of cryptography will enable the proliferation of markets like cyber markets in cyberspace.

**[23:13] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[23:14] SPEAKER_01:** And the capital will become hyper liquid and you know, will be able to flow from any place to any other place. And the governments would lose their power to tax this capital or control this capital.

**[23:26] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[23:26] SPEAKER_01:** And therefore it would like inherently change the logic of violence.

**[23:32] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[23:33] SPEAKER_01:** And yet, and this is also a very big idea in originally in crypto as well, you know, early days of Bitcoin, people would always bring out this up, this book, and yet it hasn't come to fruition.

**[23:50] SPEAKER_00:** So.

**[23:53] SPEAKER_01:** You know, just, just in case it hasn't come to fruition. And so we have to ask ourselves why? Like, I don't think, I don't think the thesis is wrong. I just, I think the thing that they missed was surveillance.

**[24:12] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[24:12] SPEAKER_01:** Because the surveillance apparatus obviously can monitor all the flows, all the activity of people. And if you can do that, then, Then you, then now you have law enforcement.

**[24:33] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[24:34] SPEAKER_01:** So yeah.

**[24:40] SPEAKER_00:** And you know, you pause a sec for sure.

**[24:44] SPEAKER_01:** I just need to listen to this.

**[24:49] SPEAKER_00:** So, you know, from what I could see, you know, you started traveling around the world a bit. Right. You, you were in various different places at different times. I mean, were you, you know, you going around meeting different people, like building, you know, building different things. How, how, how was that?

**[25:10] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I was traveling a bit. I actually come from a movement of anarchist hackers in Europe which were living in squatted buildings.

**[25:23] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[25:24] SPEAKER_01:** So you know, there's like, in Europe there's all these squatters laws which if a building is like abandoned, you can like move into the building and some, some squats, they last for years.

**[25:36] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[25:36] SPEAKER_01:** And we'd get amazing buildings. So in Amsterdam we had like a huge house.

**[25:42] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[25:42] SPEAKER_01:** Imagine we're working on free software. You know, we're broke devs.

**[25:48] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[25:48] SPEAKER_01:** It's like really is really useful lifeline to have. And also like living in the center of the cities. I mean like now even working in crypto, look at the price of property and like, it's ridiculous. Yeah, yeah, it's like really ridiculous. I think like societies really need that kind of stuff, like support people working on projects and software and stuff like that. It's a shame we don't. Anyway, I was part of those hacker movements, so I had like lots of places in Europe I could go to. You know, we would have communities, people working on free software. You know, in, in Barcelona, in London.

**[26:29] SPEAKER_00:** London, I saw places. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So when did your focus switch to Dark Wallet?

**[26:40] SPEAKER_01:** So actually I made the first coinjoin and stealth implementations in Bitcoin, which are the very first privacy techniques. And so I was working on Bitcoin implementations, nodes, but I was also focused on the privacy. So I already did those projects before.

**[27:00] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[27:00] SPEAKER_01:** And then the Dark Wallet, I was like, we need to create a product. Like, we need to create like a wallet or something.

**[27:06] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[27:07] SPEAKER_01:** So that's why, you know, we made the Dark Wallet.

**[27:13] SPEAKER_00:** And when did you first meet Vitalik?

**[27:18] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I was so, I was like, I say I was living in these squats around Europe.

**[27:22] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[27:22] SPEAKER_01:** So after 2012, then. Then there was like, okay. There was like a friend I met many, many years ago when I was hitchhiking and he was really cool dude. And I just saw him randomly on the Internet and I was like, bro, I'm making a conference. Come to my conference. He's like, okay. And I didn't hear back from him.

**[27:43] SPEAKER_00:** Okay.

**[27:43] SPEAKER_01:** It turns out he likes. He just. He walked onto a ferry without any documentation from. He came from Estonia, across Europe.

**[27:50] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[27:51] SPEAKER_01:** He came into England and he was like. He now looked like Jesus, but he had like long hair and long beard and stuff.

**[27:57] SPEAKER_00:** Didn't look good for an entry.

**[27:59] SPEAKER_01:** Anyway, Mihai.

**[28:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah.

**[28:01] SPEAKER_01:** Met him at the conference and was like enchanted by him. He was like, I just met this guy, your friend. He looks like Jesus, man. Like. And then I can't remember like how it happened. But yeah, so then he. He was meant to come back with me to my house, but actually he missed the train.

**[28:20] SPEAKER_00:** Okay.

**[28:21] SPEAKER_01:** And so he ended up just walking into a random building in London and that was like the building of the Occupy activists.

**[28:28] SPEAKER_00:** Right, Right.

**[28:29] SPEAKER_01:** I went there and then Mihai came and we just started living there and then.

**[28:33] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[28:33] SPEAKER_01:** Started setting up our hat club right there. But then also I have friends in Spain that are hackers that also. They're making these communities. They also had Califo. So then they started.

**[28:44] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Which was right near Barcelona. Right?

**[28:48] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So I was living with Mihaly, I think for like a year in London.

**[28:51] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[28:52] SPEAKER_01:** And then we went to California in Barcelona.

**[28:55] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[28:56] SPEAKER_01:** And Mihai was. Co founded the bitcoin magazine Vitalik.

**[29:00] SPEAKER_00:** Right, Right.

**[29:01] SPEAKER_01:** And so then I was also working on the bitcoin magazine with them.

**[29:04] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, I see. Right, right.

**[29:06] SPEAKER_01:** You know, not. I wasn't. I didn't write loads of stuff. It was mainly those guys writing stuff. But like, for example, like I helped Mihai with the graphic design.

**[29:15] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[29:15] SPEAKER_01:** Like some of the covers I helped design with.

**[29:18] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[29:18] SPEAKER_01:** When we were high.

**[29:19] SPEAKER_00:** There you go.

**[29:20] SPEAKER_01:** So then anyway, we went to California and Then Vitalik came to live with us.

**[29:26] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[29:27] SPEAKER_01:** And so then it was. And then there was like two other Spanish hackers which are old friends of mine and we, we were working together on projects.

**[29:36] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[29:36] SPEAKER_01:** So.

**[29:37] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[29:38] SPEAKER_01:** That was when we started Dark Wallet.

**[29:40] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[29:40] SPEAKER_01:** And I knew Cody from the conference, so I said like, oh, Cody, let's start.

**[29:46] SPEAKER_00:** Which conference? From the Amsterdam conference, the London one, The one that you. Right, right. And was that the one that you organized?

**[29:55] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I did the 2011 one in Prague.

**[29:57] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[29:57] SPEAKER_01:** 2012 one in London as well.

**[29:59] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[30:00] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So yeah, at the time we were working together in the hack lab. Mihaly had his a. I think it was Akasha. I'm not sure.

**[30:10] SPEAKER_00:** No, I think he did that later.

**[30:12] SPEAKER_01:** Oh no, it was Agora or something.

**[30:14] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[30:14] SPEAKER_01:** Anyway, he was creating like a. I guess what Dark Fire is going to be now, like social network marketplace kind of thing.

**[30:22] SPEAKER_00:** Okay.

**[30:23] SPEAKER_01:** So then he was working on that and my friends were working on that and Vitalik was working on bitcoin stuff. I was working on bitcoin stuff.

**[30:33] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[30:34] SPEAKER_01:** And then he was also working for. They were working on the magazine.

**[30:37] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[30:38] SPEAKER_01:** So we were doing like a whole bunch of stuff there in the hack lab.

**[30:41] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. Right.

**[30:42] SPEAKER_01:** And you know, we co founded the Dark Wallet.

**[30:46] SPEAKER_00:** Right. And Peter Todd as well.

**[30:50] SPEAKER_01:** No, Peter Toddler later.

**[30:52] SPEAKER_00:** Right, yeah.

**[30:53] SPEAKER_01:** But you can see the original Dark Wallet from that video announcement video on YouTube and it has all the co founders listed.

**[31:01] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[31:03] SPEAKER_01:** So yeah, we, we were working on that then about. And, and then the, so this. So the CIC was a network of 10,000 cooperatives throughout Catalonia.

**[31:16] SPEAKER_00:** Okay.

**[31:16] SPEAKER_01:** The whole reason that was made is because there's like a big anarchist movement in Catalonia.

**[31:21] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah.

**[31:21] SPEAKER_01:** And they, you know, they'd been doing their thing for many years.

**[31:26] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[31:27] SPEAKER_01:** But then they started to mature as anarchists and they were like, so to think more about economics.

**[31:32] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[31:32] SPEAKER_01:** Organization and stuff.

**[31:33] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[31:34] SPEAKER_01:** It's something I also like about this Spanish tradition of anarchists.

**[31:38] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[31:38] SPEAKER_01:** They, they, they, they're a lot more organized than for example, like London where it's just like.

**[31:43] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[31:44] SPEAKER_01:** Crazy people going, you know, like. Yeah, so they, yeah, so they, they were like, okay, we need to make a network of cooperatives and properties, need to provide all the basic things that people need to live.

**[31:58] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[31:58] SPEAKER_01:** And we would therefore become autonomous from the state.

**[32:01] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[32:01] SPEAKER_01:** We'd become our own parallel system, which is cool, cool stuff. And so our team was actually the cryptocurrency part of that. They were interested in cryptocurrency because, for example, Trading inside the network allow people to avoid paying taxes because they consume from each other. But they also wanted to exchange outside of it. So they were like, we can use cryptocurrency to do that as that junction. Yeah. So we set up the first ATMs in Catalonia.

**[32:28] SPEAKER_00:** Right, Right.

**[32:30] SPEAKER_01:** Cryptocurrency as part of this cooperative.

**[32:32] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[32:32] SPEAKER_01:** But they also had a research lab, which was a giant factory complex in the Catalan countryside.

**[32:39] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[32:39] SPEAKER_01:** Which is. It was burnt down and the people came there with a proposal to the owner to buy it from the owner.

**[32:46] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[32:46] SPEAKER_01:** But then also there they had like. It was. It's like a village, basically, is massive. But they had like a industrial research sector, electronics. One of them was the hacking stuff, which is a club.

**[32:58] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[32:59] SPEAKER_01:** And that's where we were doing our cryptocurrency stuff.

**[33:01] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right.

**[33:03] SPEAKER_01:** But anyway, as part of that research of the CIC and the tools that the CIC needed, that's how we came up. We came up with these ideas, which is the ones. Maybe you've seen the page. It's on archive, right. On system one, talking about Bit law. Anyway, I'm not sure. Anyway, there's like a bunch of pages on our old wiki, right. And it's talking about, like, what applications we need to build with Bitcoin.

**[33:28] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[33:29] SPEAKER_01:** So then that's when Vitalik started to become interested in those ideas.

**[33:34] SPEAKER_00:** Right, Right.

**[33:35] SPEAKER_01:** So then afterwards he left Master Coin.

**[33:38] SPEAKER_00:** Yes.

**[33:38] SPEAKER_01:** He asked the bitcoin, he was like, oh, okay, yeah, loosen the restrictions on the opcodes. And the bitcoin people were like, no, we're not changing.

**[33:47] SPEAKER_00:** No.

**[33:48] SPEAKER_01:** And so then he went to Master Coin. Then he went to do.

**[33:53] SPEAKER_00:** He was saying he'd also seen what happened with Counterparty. Right. Where they were like chopping down the, you know, the. Yeah, the returns stuff. Yeah. It's like, okay, don't want to like, build some meta protocol on top of this if it's gonna get like, they're gonna change the mind next month. And it's like, right, you. You know, your protocols. Dead.

**[34:14] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. So, yeah. So they. Then when they were making Ethereum, that's, you know, with Anthony Delorio and all those people.

**[34:29] SPEAKER_00:** Well, yeah.

**[34:29] SPEAKER_01:** So, I mean, also a bit before the first Dark Wallet, right, was in Milan.

**[34:38] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. I was going to mention. So. So Mihai was in Milan for a fair bit. Right?

**[34:44] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, we were. We were all together. We would travel together and go to these places. But anyway, Maau's also like a really big.

**[34:54] SPEAKER_00:** Gambling, huh? No, gambling.

**[34:57] SPEAKER_01:** Oh, no, in Milan.

**[34:58] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, I thought you said Right.

**[35:00] SPEAKER_01:** It's a community center called Maau.

**[35:02] SPEAKER_00:** Oh, I see.

**[35:03] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. It's like. It's huge as well. It used to be a meat processing plant but anyway they have like loads of cultural things there. But anyway they let us use it for a month to do our event.

**[35:13] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[35:13] SPEAKER_01:** And so that's when Taylor Wendor.

**[35:17] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[35:17] SPEAKER_01:** A lot of those early Ethereum guys, right.

**[35:20] SPEAKER_00:** Hive Hive, Hive Wallet.

**[35:22] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, they came there and that's how they all met each other. Right, the early co founders.

**[35:27] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[35:27] SPEAKER_01:** And then also Richard Stott.

**[35:31] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[35:32] SPEAKER_01:** Designer. He was also my friend from London.

**[35:35] SPEAKER_00:** Oh right.

**[35:35] SPEAKER_01:** That's how Mihai met him.

**[35:37] SPEAKER_00:** I see.

**[35:37] SPEAKER_01:** And Gav Wood also came to visit us in London, in the city.

**[35:41] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. Mihai was so Vitalic had shared like a few years ago, shared early his. His first communications with Gav where Gav contacted him on 19th December 2013 through About Me and Gav said where. He said, where are you with Ethereum? I can do C basically. And then four days later he'd. He'd created his. His repo to start working on CPP Ethereum. But. But over the other bit I forgot there is. Johnny gave me the heads up. That's what he said. Which was Johnny Bitcoin, who he had met through you. Right. So Gavin came to the squat at some point in London.

**[36:46] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah. We were hanging out because he said he's a KDE developer.

**[36:51] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[36:51] SPEAKER_01:** He's written the lirc.

**[36:53] SPEAKER_00:** Right. I think in one of the interviews he said I'm gonna give my KDE email because it'll like. That'll give me cred.

**[37:03] SPEAKER_01:** Oh yeah, yeah, he did it did. I was like impressed by it. I was like, yeah. I was like, whoa, got a KDE email.

**[37:10] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[37:10] SPEAKER_01:** That's impressive.

**[37:11] SPEAKER_00:** That's right.

**[37:12] SPEAKER_01:** So that's funny. It worked.

**[37:17] SPEAKER_00:** It did. So he came along and then I guess, you know, he was talking to Johnny and Johnny must have mentioned Vitalik and Ethereum and pointed him onwards.

**[37:31] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, I, Yeah, I also went. I visited them in Anthony Delorio's. That's where that hackathon.

**[37:41] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. So. So yeah.

**[37:43] SPEAKER_01:** Is Anthony Delorio a co founder of Ethereum?

**[37:46] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. So put money into Ethereum. Yeah, he did.

**[37:49] SPEAKER_01:** What happened to that money?

**[37:52] SPEAKER_00:** He did. Well, yeah, he got it. So he lent. He basically, you know, lent money to the project for those early months of development. He did get paid back out of, you know, the crowd sale. There was some court case where it was like, did he get it back as Bitcoin or as. Or as Fiat? You know, there was some kind of like disagreement on that. But you know that, that, that got finished off. But yeah, the timeline was Vitalik did the white paper in about November 2013. He shared it with a bunch of people. I don't know if he shared it with you, if you were on that list of people who got it early. Oh, right, the bit law. Yeah, yeah. Right. So just a whole bunch of different. Right, so, so yeah, transparency arbitration, auditing and transparency multisigs. Yeah. A whole bunch of cryptocurrency 2.0 use cases.

**[38:58] SPEAKER_01:** So they, they did ask me to be the lead Ethereum dev.

**[39:01] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[39:02] SPEAKER_01:** But I, I just didn't, I was like, we can build this on bitcoin.

**[39:05] SPEAKER_00:** Right, Right. Why do you need a new thing?

**[39:08] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, yeah, because I, I know you can build it on bitcoin.

**[39:12] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[39:12] SPEAKER_01:** At the time.

**[39:13] SPEAKER_00:** But yeah, that December.

**[39:15] SPEAKER_01:** And I kept, I kept also pressing the guy, right. To explain to me what it can be used for.

**[39:21] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[39:21] SPEAKER_01:** And he, he just kind of in frustration just went, marriage contracts.

**[39:30] SPEAKER_00:** Not so appealing. No, no, don't see the point. But yeah, December.

**[39:35] SPEAKER_01:** It's interesting because sometimes you can be too close minded about things.

**[39:39] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right. But yeah, that December, you know, after he shared the white paper around, you know, various people started gathering around.

**[39:46] SPEAKER_01:** I think what led to Ethereum's success was having a token. Having the token is like really good because it allows the project to accrue value.

**[39:55] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[39:55] SPEAKER_01:** Whereas working on Bitcoin we always broke.

**[39:58] SPEAKER_00:** Right, right, right. Yeah. I mean those, those early months, you know, no one was being paid on Ethereum either. And it's like, you know, we will have a token sale, you will get paid back. But you know, it's, it's, you know, hoping a dream but, but yeah, the, the, the hackathon that you're talking about was in April of 2014 in Toronto. So Anthony Diorio running that, he'd got, you know, bitcoin decentral sort of co working space and venue. There were a bunch of projects running out of there. You know, it was kind of like, yeah, he'd say sort of like businesses running, I mean, I don't know how great businesses they were. Projects were operating out of that. And then one of the things that they did was organize this first Canadian bitcoin conference to which it's funny, so he got the space. He was the head of the Bitcoin association of Canada. The Bitcoin association were running the conference. Ethereum were the main sponsor for the conference. So it was like his space, his organization, his conference, his sponsors. And somebody said at some point, is this how marketing works? That you've just got all these different hands that are all paying each other? It's like, oh, there's a lot of activity here, but it's all, it's all, you know, from that same source. But yeah, but there was a hackathon.

**[41:34] SPEAKER_01:** So he did get cocked.

**[41:39] SPEAKER_00:** I don't, I don't know. But, but, but, yeah, so there was the hackathon that you were at, you and Cody presenting, you know, dark.

**[41:49] SPEAKER_01:** Well, I.

**[41:50] SPEAKER_00:** It was, I guess it was dark market, wasn't it, that, that you'd got.

**[41:54] SPEAKER_01:** That one which became Open Bazaar.

**[41:57] SPEAKER_00:** Right. And. And then there was the main conference with. So, yes, the aforementioned Peter Todd was there, Andreas Antonopoulos, Dave Johnston, you'd got Adam B. Levine as well and a bunch of others. But yeah, that conference was also the only conference where there was ever like an Ethereal, An Ethereum store, you know, like the expo area. They were like, hey, you know, we're the, we're like, you know, it was like a business, right? It's like, here's a business project. At that point, Anthony's thought and expectation was like, all of this is going to happen out of, out of Toronto. Right. Ethereum is just one of n projects that are happening out of bitcoin. Decentralized. But lots of the projects in that hackathon were on Ethereum as well. But what you were building was not.

**[43:02] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, that's why I said didn't need to be.

**[43:05] SPEAKER_00:** No, no.

**[43:06] SPEAKER_01:** The thing is, I was quite an expert in bitcoin. So obviously it's like difficult for people who don't know bitcoin deeply to do those things. That's the thing I missed is actually having something with like a language, etc. It's like, it's easier for people.

**[43:25] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, absolutely. So, I mean, can you remember, like, what the vibe was like at that conference as to paired compared to other bitcoin conferences you've been at?

**[43:36] SPEAKER_01:** It was a fun conference. Wasn't like an exceptional conference. Yeah, I had a good time. I was just going around chatting to people. Yeah, it's good.

**[43:45] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[43:47] SPEAKER_01:** I remember Adam Levine and Stephanie and Andreas.

**[43:52] SPEAKER_00:** Right? Yeah.

**[43:53] SPEAKER_01:** Out with each other a lot.

**[43:54] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah. So I mean, I guess, you know, Ethereum kind of, you know, kept ticking along there. Like, was that something, you know, happening in parallel or you were you still kind of crossing paths with these people.

**[44:13] SPEAKER_01:** Through that year, interactive Ethereum after that?

**[44:16] SPEAKER_00:** No, no. And I mean in, in terms of.

**[44:23] SPEAKER_01:** Like, I think all the Money started to come in and they all started to go. And then I was in like Europe.

**[44:29] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[44:29] SPEAKER_01:** Then I went to Syria, so.

**[44:31] SPEAKER_00:** Yes, yes. But yeah, I mean the timeline of that was Ethereum white paper November kind of team starting together about December. BTC Miami. Were you at BTC Miami in January? Did you go to that one?

**[44:48] SPEAKER_01:** No, I went to the Toronto thing.

**[44:51] SPEAKER_00:** Right. So then, yeah, Toronto in April and the crowd sale actually was like July, August ish of 2014. And then you had the Ethereum foundation starting to do the crowd sale and then. Yeah, early, early contributors got like paid back for their work in those prior months and you know, Ethereum was often live.

**[45:24] SPEAKER_01:** We did the dark market just purely for money.

**[45:28] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[45:29] SPEAKER_01:** Because, you know, 50.

**[45:32] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[45:32] SPEAKER_01:** So that was pretty cool.

**[45:35] SPEAKER_00:** And, and I mean with, with Dark Wallet, like what kind of time span were you working on that for?

**[45:44] SPEAKER_01:** We, I think we started in 2013 and then we were working on it all the way to the end of 2014.

**[45:53] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[45:54] SPEAKER_01:** And we released an alpha, which crowdfunding was for the alpha. We never released the stable.

**[46:00] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[46:00] SPEAKER_01:** And that's mainly because I went to Syria, but I thought the dev team would at least like just finish it, you know.

**[46:06] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[46:07] SPEAKER_01:** They had enough money and everything.

**[46:08] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Didn't happen.

**[46:10] SPEAKER_01:** They kind of like it just fizzled out without my presence, which I guess, like it's a failing of my leadership not to create an organization that doesn't fizzle out when, you know, one person disappears. So.

**[46:23] SPEAKER_00:** And with Libitcoin, was that ongoing as well as what you were doing?

**[46:27] SPEAKER_01:** So it's had like serious technical innovation in there.

**[46:31] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[46:32] SPEAKER_01:** Has like the fastest like blockchain database of any bitcoin node. And this guy, Eric Voskor, who's really skilled developer, he came and he like took on that mission and he's still continuing it. Yeah, he's like just really into it. I've tried a few times to poach him to Dark Phi zk, other stuff. He's a really good developer, but he's just like. No, I just like Bitcoin.

**[46:55] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[46:56] SPEAKER_01:** Just do. I just work on Lib Bitcoin. So yeah, he's laser focused on that.

**[47:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yes. I. I've got to meet him in person for the first time last year, I think after Fair Play, after, after.

**[47:07] SPEAKER_01:** Lots of, you know, me, like advanced dysregulated focus.

**[47:13] SPEAKER_00:** Right. Yeah. Well, I mean, he's just beaten at that for 10 years.

**[47:19] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, it's crazy.

**[47:20] SPEAKER_00:** It will be 10 years. Imagine working on one project and also, you know, he's like, yeah, it's not production ready yet.

**[47:30] SPEAKER_01:** He is a really good developer, but yeah, he is.

**[47:33] SPEAKER_00:** And he's also, he's published some stats, you know, the last year or so.

**[47:37] SPEAKER_01:** They just need money really.

**[47:39] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, but he's cool with it as well. He's just like, yeah, you know, I'm just, I'm just working and I'll keep working until it's done and, and yeah, I mean he's got to the point where he's published some stats in the last year or so and you know, it's just massively better. You know, it's just, yeah, just the whole thing rethrunk. Right. And, and, and, and re. Stripped down and built up from that base. Yeah, yeah. So I mean early days of Ethereum. What are your thoughts on Ethereum? Like having, having seen it being birthed. What's, what's Ethereum to you?

**[48:21] SPEAKER_01:** It is the closest expression of the Agora as existing crypto. Now they've done a lot of really good research. I have like, you know, I think Ethereum needs to develop a political philosophy. The one with Ethereum is very historical. Like it like if you do science you need your like evidence is. If you're doing, when you do science you need evidence to like support your theories. It's like all well and good having models, like abstract, like deductive mathematical models, but you need to like back test your ideas. And when we talk about like social systems, what that is, is history historical. The thing is with Ethereum, whenever they talk about history, it's always like the most minor or like society, most minor examples are completely inoffensive because they don't want to take a stance on anything. And I don't think you can be like that. I think you have to take, go deep into things, take them apart, etc. You know. So I think that's really harming them especially they like want to change the world, do things of social benefit. That's why they're making now these zoo Zalu, you know, these kind of network state communities. Yeah, they're trying to recreate the color faux thing. The colorful experience.

**[49:44] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[49:44] SPEAKER_01:** Where we were developing tools for the cic, the cooperatives and that allowed us to see what people need. So I respect the intention, but I think like the problem is, is that you don't, when you make a project, you don't gather a group of people together and go, what should we do first you come up with the idea, you develop the idea and then you recruit people for roles to fulfill that Objective that mission. So they're, you know, they're doing, they're doing the opposite. They're trying to bring loads of people together and see what happens. And I think there's like the reason why Ethereum has these like roadmap diagrams, which are like these like really arcane plots of stuff, but it's like, what's the organizing idea underneath that? And they don't have one.

**[50:41] SPEAKER_00:** So anyway, no, I mean it's been a criticism I've had for a number of years is you'll see Vitalik, you know, plop out this big roadmap diagram thing and I remember first looking at it and there were three little boxes in the top corner that were transitioned to proof of stake. Three boxes that took eight years and you've got 50 odd things on this diagram. And it's like there's decades and decades of work to do all of this. And also, you know that the plan is going to change every year anyway. Like it's not, you're never going to get to the end of that. And it's like, yeah, what's feature complete? What are you aiming for? Like, when's good enough.

**[51:26] SPEAKER_01:** I also think Ethereum needs to be more product focused.

**[51:30] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[51:30] SPEAKER_01:** I don't mean product focused by like paying lots of useless focus groups or like UI designers that used to work at Facebook or something like that.

**[51:40] SPEAKER_00:** I mean, right.

**[51:41] SPEAKER_01:** Actually going, you know, what is it we want to do?

**[51:45] SPEAKER_00:** Yes.

**[51:46] SPEAKER_01:** How do we develop the tech to fulfill that objective and aggressively pursue.

**[51:51] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[51:52] SPEAKER_01:** Like one or two use cases. Deliver them.

**[51:55] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[51:55] SPEAKER_01:** And expand that. Like, not like Ethereum is like it was, it was made in a time when you can launch absolutely anything and it would succeed and you know, they did really well. But the thing, the thing is, is people see what Ethereum did and they think that's gospel for how to like start a new, a new project in crypto. It's like the Ethereum playbook and I think that's, maybe that's hampering a lot of people and that actually, you know, the, when you, the Ethereum early on was like, we're like apolitical, we're a neutral technology.

**[52:39] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah. You know, blah, blah, application platform.

**[52:42] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. And I think it just didn't, it didn't, it hasn't. They need to be more strategic.

**[52:50] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[52:50] SPEAKER_01:** Like when you, when you make a, when you make a project, you know, have an end goal that you want to get to, you have a strategy.

**[52:57] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah.

**[52:57] SPEAKER_01:** And you have a roadmap and you have milestones in the roadmap yes. And I think it's really important that underlying technologies are developed in parallel to applications and the people using them.

**[53:10] SPEAKER_00:** Right.

**[53:10] SPEAKER_01:** So yeah, when you develop applications and you field them, then you get, you see how the technology needs to evolve. Otherwise, you know, when you give technology to the hands of technologists and this is what theorem has also suffered from.

**[53:27] SPEAKER_00:** They'Re like kind of builds, build stuff that's interesting to them.

**[53:30] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah, exactly. And it becomes arcane, like, oh, we need this and we need this and we need this. And it's like, actually it doesn't even fulfill any of the use cases that.

**[53:40] SPEAKER_00:** Well, no, no, no, I mean it shouldn't be hard, right? It's thinking, okay, well who are our users and what do they want to do? And let's do that.

**[53:50] SPEAKER_01:** It's really difficult to talk to like the Ethereum clique core thing, you know, it's very cliquey. So they have a big political problem, I think.

**[54:00] SPEAKER_00:** Yeah, yeah. And I think that sort of almost unbounded scope is, is problematic. Something Nick Szabo talks about is the idea of argument surface. So he's drawing an analogy with, you know, attack surface for security stuff and is saying on a social level, the argument surface for a system is basically like, how much stuff is there that's like up for grabs, that's not like defined that you can have a reasonable argument about, we should do this, we should do that, we should do the other. And if you have a really well defined system, right, where it's very clear what this thing is for and what it's meant to do and like, have we met these needs or not? You don't have all the arguments because you all know what you're building. You don't fuck about like changing the design or plans or anything because you've all got that common goal. So then the criticism there of Ethereum is that there's almost infinite arguments surface become like a parliament, right? So you've all got protocol politicians and lobbying groups and you can sit and fucking argue about this for years on end of like, oh, we should have this feature, that feature this, protocol this, the other. And a lot of those aren't necessarily actually moving you to something that is actually solving real use case problems that's actually getting people, you know, using the tech. Okay, well thanks. Well, thank you very much for your time. Would you like to just say a little bit about Dark 5 before we wrap?

**[55:46] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Oh yes. Dark Fires and L1, you can do everything with it, but anonymous, so you know, you can you can, like, buy and sell. You can make anonymous styles, do OTC, etc. That's what we need to build the agora.

**[56:11] SPEAKER_00:** So I've heard some people say, perhaps Monero is smart contracts. Would that be reasonable?

**[56:19] SPEAKER_01:** But we're not using Ring six, we're using Z.

**[56:22] SPEAKER_00:** So zcash with smart contracts?

**[56:27] SPEAKER_01:** Yeah. Well, yeah, maybe. Yeah.

**[56:31] SPEAKER_00:** Okay. Thanks so much.

**[56:33] SPEAKER_01:** Thank you.
